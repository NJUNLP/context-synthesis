{"context": "Republican House and Senate negotiators released their thousand-page tax bill Friday evening, getting one step closer to passing sweeping legislation that would provide deep tax cuts for corporations and tax breaks for the wealthy, while offering what most economists say are more limited benefits for middle-class Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would lower the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax which ensures corporations pay at least some tax on their income, lower the top individual income tax rate and raise the threshold for inheritances to be subject to the estate tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It lowers tax rates overall within seven brackets, and keeps popular deductions including ones for student loans, medical expenses and charitable giving, and curtails the mortgage interest deduction and deductions people take on state and local taxes if they choose not to take the standard tax deduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individuals may see some relief in the form of a doubled standard deduction, but at least two independent analyses have found that people making less than $75,000 would actually pay more in taxes in the next ten years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimates, the plan would add $1.455 trillion to the deficit over next 10 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress is expected to begin voting on the bill early next week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House applauded the plan in a statement and said that \"President Trump is on the precipice of fulfilling that promise\" to Americans to \"provide much needed financial relief to all Americans.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump had previously called GOP efforts to provide tax cuts a \"big, beautiful Christmas present\" to the American people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Democrats roundly criticized the plan on Friday as one they feel benefits the wealthy at the expense of middle income Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I’m surprised anyone can call this a tax reform bill with a straight face. This is nothing more than a huge tax cut for big corporations and the rich, paid for by the middle class,\" Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif. tweeted after the plan was released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., questioned the timing of the bill's release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Republicans just released their final tax bill at 5:30 on a Friday. It’s almost like they don’t want you to know what’s in the bill. #GOPTaxScam — Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) December 15, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two key Republican holdouts did a 180-degree turn on Friday and now support the GOP tax bill: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While several Republicans had said they were waiting to see the final bill, right now, it does not appear a single Republican is on the record as a \"no\" vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For far too long, Washington has ignored and left behind the American working class. Increasing the refundability of the Child Tax Credit from 55% to 70% is a solid step toward broader reforms which are both Pro-Growth and Pro-Worker. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 15, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rubio, who on Thursday was a \"no' vote, now appears on board after Republicans expanded the child tax credit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corker, who was the sole Republican to oppose the original Senate bill over concerns about the deficit, is also now a yes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After great thought and consideration, I believe that this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make U.S. businesses domestically more productive and internationally more competitive is one we should not miss,\" Corker said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it. I realize this is a bet on our country’s enterprising spirit, and that is a bet I am willing to make.\" he concludes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, also shared the same concerns with Rubio about the child tax credit. On Friday, Lee signaled he might be coming around in support of the bill in a statement to ABC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sens. Rubio, Heller, and Scott have done a tremendous job fighting for working families this week and they have secured a big win,” Lee said. “I look forward to reading the full text of the bill and, hopefully, supporting it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, there were concerns the potential absence of Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., could complicate the bill's chances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCain, who is undergoing treatment for an aggressive form of brain cancer, was not at work Thursday in the U.S. Senate. His office reported that he is \"receiving treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center for normal side effects of his ongoing cancer therapy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House Speaker Paul Ryan said that considerations of absences in the Senate could impact which chamber takes the first votes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cheriss May/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is discussion about this,\" Ryan said. \"It's all about timing and managing absences in the Senate.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR GOP leaders are optimistic that they will get this done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if he’s confident this will pass, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, responded with just one word: “yes.” ||||| Republicans were joyful Friday as they finalized their tax plan, bridging differences between the House and Senate bills and moving another step closer to getting legislation to President Trump by Christmas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also appear to have locked down the votes they need to pass the measure through the House and Senate after Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) pledged their support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act represents the largest one-time reduction in the corporate tax rate in U.S. history, from 35 percent down to 21 percent. The bill also lowers taxes for the vast majority of Americans, as well as small-business owners — at least until the cuts expire after eight years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last-minute changes to the GOP's big plan give a larger tax break to the wealthy and preserves certain tax savings for the middle class, including the student-loan interest deduction, the deduction for excessive medical expenses and the tax break for graduate students. A change made Friday morning to win over Rubio expands the child tax credit even further to give more money to working-class families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's a rundown of what's in the final bill. (If you want to read all 505 pages, click here.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is changing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new tax cut for the rich: The final plan lowers the top tax rate for top earners. Under current law, the highest rate is 39.6 percent for married couples earning over $470,700. The GOP bill would drop that to 37 percent and raise the threshold at which that top rate kicks in, to $500,000 for individuals and $600,000 for married couples. This amounts to a significant tax break for the very wealthy, a departure from repeated claims by Trump and his top officials that the bill would not benefit the rich. The new tax break for millionaires goes beyond what was in the original House and Senate bills, with Republicans seeking to ensure wealthy earners in states such as New York, Connecticut and California don't end up paying substantially higher taxes as a result of the bill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A massive tax cut for corporations: Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, big businesses' tax rate would fall from 35 percent to just 21 percent, the largest one-time rate cut in U.S. history for the nation's largest companies. The House and Senate bills originally had the big-business tax rate falling to 20 percent, but Republicans were not able to make the math work to keep the rate that low and start it right away in the new year, so they compromised by moving the rate to 21 percent. It still amounts to roughly a $1 trillion tax cut for businesses over the next decade. Republicans argue this will make the economy surge in the coming years, but most independent economists and Wall Street banks predict only a modest and short-lived boost to growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can deduct just $10,000 in state, local and property taxes: One of the most controversial parts of the GOP tax plan is the push to greatly scale back how much state and local taxes Americans can deduct on their federal income taxes. Under current law, the state and local deduction (SALT) is unlimited. In the final GOP plan, people can deduct up to $10,000 (married couples are also limited to just $10,000). The House initially restricted the $10,000 deduction to just property taxes, but the final bill allows any state and local taxes to be deducted, whether for property, income or sales taxes. The move is widely viewed as a hit to blue states such as New York, Connecticut and California, and there are concerns it could cause property values to fall in high-tax cities and leave less money for public schools and road repairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most Americans will pay less in taxes until 2026. The final plan lowers the tax rates for each income level and nearly doubles the standard deduction (while also scrapping the personal exemption). The result is that the vast majority of Americans will see their tax bills drop next year. Trump is fond of saying the \"typical\" family will save $2,000, but the reality is the amount will vary greatly depending up the size, location and circumstances of each family. The bill will also increase the number of Americans who owe nothing in taxes from 44 percent today to 47.5 percent after the plan tax effect on January 1, 2018. But all of the individual tax cuts are scheduled to go away after 2025. Republicans opted to make tax cuts for families temporary and reductions for businesses permanent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Working-class families get a bigger child tax credit: Thanks to a late push by Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the child tax credit would be more generous for low-income families and the working class. The current child tax credit is $1,000 per child. The House and Senate bills expanded the child tax credit, with the Senate going up to a maximum of $2,000 per child. The final bill keeps the $2,000-per-child credit (families making up to about $400,000 get to take the credit), but it also makes more of the tax credit refundable, meaning families that work but don't earn enough to actually owe any federal income taxes will get a large check back from the government. Benefits for those families were initially limited to about $1,100, but through changes Rubio and Lee pushed for, it's now up to $1,400. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The individual health insurance mandate goes away in 2019: Beginning in 2019, Americans would no longer be required by law to buy health insurance (or pay a penalty if they don't). The individual mandate is part of the Affordable Care Act, and removing it was a top priority for Trump and congressional Republicans. The final bill does not start the repeal until 2019, though. The Congressional Budget Office projects the change will increase insurance premiums and lead to 13 million fewer Americans with insurance in a decade, while also cutting government spending by more than $300 billion over that period. Some Republicans hope to make other changes to health care to prevent insurance costs from rising dramatically by the time the repeal kicks in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can pass your heirs up to $22 million tax-free: In the end, the estate tax (often called the “death tax” by opponents) would remain part of the U.S. tax code, but far fewer families will pay it. Under current law, Americans can pass on up to $5.5 million tax-free (that threshold is $11 million for married couples). The House wanted to do away with the estate tax entirely, but some senators felt that was too much of a giveaway to the mega-rich. The final compromise was to double the threshold, so now the first $11 million that people pass on to their heirs in property, stocks and other assets won't be taxed (and yes, that means $22 million for married couples). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Pass through” companies get a 20 percent reduction: Most American businesses are organized as “pass through” companies in which the income from the business is “passed through” to the business owner's individual tax return. S corporations, LLCs, partnerships and sole proprietorships are all examples of pass-through businesses. In the final GOP bill, the majority of these companies get to deduct 20 percent of their income tax-free, a large reduction that mirrors what was in the Senate bill. The changes, however, expire after 2025. The National Federation of Independent Business initially opposed the House version, arguing that it didn't do enough for small businesses. But the NFIB later endorsed the House and Senate plans. Service businesses such as law firms, doctor's offices and investment offices can take only the 20 percent deduction if they make up to $315,000 (for married couples). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No corporate “AMT” tax: The final GOP bill gets rid of the corporate alternative minimum tax, a big relief to the business community. The Senate included the corporate AMT in its version of the bill, but the House did not. The corporate AMT makes it difficult for businesses to reduce their tax bill much lower than 21 percent. CEOs complained that this was a backdoor tax that would make them less likely to build new plants, buy more equipment and invest in more research, since the corporate AMT made the tax credits for those investments essentially null and void. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fewer families will have to pay the individual AMT: The AMT for individuals started in 1969 as a way to prevent rich families from using so many credits and loopholes to lower their tax bill to almost nothing. But what started out as a way to prevent the wealthiest Americans from tax dodging started to hit more and more families over time. Currently, the AMT kicks in fully for individuals earning over $120,700 and married couples earning over $160,900. Under the final Senate bill, that threshold is lifted to $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for married couples. (Some families in the $200,000 to $500,000 range will still have to pay AMT, but they will pay far less than they were before). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mortgage interest deduction gets smaller: Under the current tax code, taxpayers can deduct any interest they pay on up to $1 million worth of mortgage loans. House Republicans tried to cap that at $500,000 for new loans (existing mortgages are unaffected by the plan) but in the final version of their, Republicans have settled on a $750,000 cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final bill costs $1.46 trillion: Republicans decided it would be all right to go into debt up to $1.5 trillion to fund the tax cut. In the end, they nearly hit that mark. The official estimate -- released Friday evening alongside the bill -- came in at $1.46 trillion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is NOT changing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bill keeps in place the student loan deduction, the medical expense deduction and the graduate student tuition waivers. The House bill got rid of these popular deductions, but the Senate bill kept them, and the final bill even makes the medical deduction a bit more generous for awhile (dropping the threshold to take the deduction from expenses over 10 percent of income to expenses over 7.5 percent of income for 2017 and 2018). After that, the medical deduction threshold reverts to 10 percent). In the end, Republicans decided it was better to allow millions of middle-class families to continue using these breaks if they qualify for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans stay the same. No changes to the tax-free amounts people are allowed to put into 401(k)s, IRAs and Roth IRAs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Churches, synagogues, mosques and other nonprofits (the Johnson Amendment stays in place) can't get political and endorse candidates in elections. Trump and conservative Republicans wanted to “totally destroy” (Trump's words) the Johnson Amendment, which has been in place since 1954 and prevents religious institutions and nonprofits from getting involved in elections via fundraising or endorsements. The House bill included a repeal of the Johnson Amendment, but Democrats were able to get the Senate parliamentarian to determine that including the repeal in the bill didn't comply with the rules of the Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the CBO's estimates for the number of uninsured Americans in 10 years. It predicts 13 million fewer people will have health insurance if the individual mandate is lifted. ||||| Republicans late Friday afternoon unveiled the final text of their bill to rewrite the tax code, which they are racing to send to President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump officials to announce closure of Palestinian Liberation Organization office in DC: report Alibaba's Jack Ma to step down as chairman in 2019 Trump expected to soon declassify Carter Page, Bruce Ohr documents: report MORE’s desk before Christmas.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House will vote on the bill first, on Tuesday, and then the Senate will vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the final bill, the top individual rate would be lowered from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, which is lower than the top rate in the original bills passed by the House and Senate. The corporate tax rate would be cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, up from 20 percent in the original bills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The measure has seven individual tax brackets, and like both the House and Senate bills, substantially increases the standard deduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, as the Senate bill did, and increases the maximum amount that is refundable to $1,400, up from $1,100 in the original Senate measure. The latter change was made to secure Rubio’s vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The legislation preserves the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving, though it lowers the cap on the mortgage deduction from $1 million to $750,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seeking to win over House Republicans from high-tax states, the conference committee legislation caps the state and local tax deduction at $10,000, with filers allowed to deduct property taxes and state and local income and sales taxes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several popular tax preferences that were eliminated in the House bill are preserved. They include the deduction for medical expenses, the deduction for student-loan interest, the exclusion for graduate students’ tuition waivers and the ability to issue tax-exempt private-activity bonds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bill does not repeal the estate tax or the alternative minimum tax for individuals, both long-time goals for Republicans, but it does increase the exemption amounts. The corporate alternative minimum tax, which was retained in the Senate bill, is eliminated, a change that is certain to please the business community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final bill provides tax relief to pass-through businesses — entities such as small businesses whose income is taxed through the individual code — through a 20-percent deduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Rob Portman Robert (Rob) Jones PortmanOvernight Health Care: Kavanaugh questioned if Roe v.

The Senate’s policies were “viewed as simpler,” Portman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The measure also moves the U.S. to a territorial tax system that generally does not subject American companies’ foreign earnings to U.S. taxes. Companies’ current offshore earnings would be taxed at rates of 15.5 percent for liquid assets and 8 percent for illiquid assets, which are higher rates than in both the House and Senate bills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the Senate bill, the legislation repeals ObamaCare’s individual insurance mandate starting in 2019 and allows for drilling in a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans are advancing the measure through a process called reconciliation that prevents a filibuster from Democrats in the Senate. Under reconciliation, bills can’t add to the deficit after 10 years, so the bill’s tax cuts for individuals expire after eight years. The corporate tax changes and individual mandate repeal are permanent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House and the Senate are expected to approve the bill next week and send it to Trump, delivering him his first major legislative victory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans have long wanted to rewrite the tax code, arguing that doing so would boost economic growth and lead to more job creation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the bill will lower federal revenue by $1.456 trillion over 10 years — a key finding, as the bill cannot add more than $1.5 trillion in debt and qualify for special Senate rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most analysts doubt that the economic growth from the bill will offset the revenue losses, but GOP lawmakers and the White House disagree. They say the changes to the tax code will unleash business investment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corker, who voted against the original Senate bill because of deficit concerns, said in a statement Friday that he will vote for the final package because he thinks the bill accompanied with other policies “could have significant positive impact on the well-being of Americans and help drive additional foreign direct investment in Tennessee.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Rubio's and Corker’s support boosts the odds for passage, several GOP senators have not yet announced how they will vote, including Sens.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then the drug was sent to treat a Spanish priest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's the problem with experimental drugs that have never been clinically tested in humans: No one knows whether they'll work -- and if they do, in whom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week, the World Health Organization gathered a group of ethicists to decide whether unproven medications and vaccines should be used in the current Ebola outbreak. As the death toll from the epidemic soared over 1,000, the WHO panel unanimously concluded that it is ethical to offer medications to fight the Ebola virus, even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The large number of people affected by the 2014 west Africa outbreak, and the high case-fatality rate, have prompted calls to use investigational medical interventions to try to save the lives of patients and to curb the epidemic,\" the World Health Organization said Tuesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The difference between this outbreak and other Ebola outbreaks is that traditional methods of stopping the virus from spreading -- protective gear, contact tracing, etc. -- don't seem to be working fast enough, said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's assistant director-general. The health care systems in the affected countries are also weak, so resources are scarce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If these treatments can save lives ... should we not use them to save lives?\" Kieny said the panel asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the panel's decision, Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose announced Tuesday her government will donate between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to WHO. A \"small supply\" will be kept at home \"in the unlikely event it is needed for compassionate use in Canada,\" the Public Health Agency said in a news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug -- called VSV-EBOV -- is Canadian-made and owned, having been developed by the National Microbiology Laboratory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's never been tested on humans, \"but has shown promise in animal research,\" the agency states. A Canadian government ethics advisory group and the WHO panel of medical ethics experts both \"informed\" the decision to give out VSV-EBOV, despite its \"unknown efficacy and adverse effects.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will it work is just one of the key questions surrounding VSV-EBOV. As with ZMapp, other questions include how and on whom it should be used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A vicious killer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ebola can torment its victims with high fevers, internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea. It often afflicts multiple organ systems and can kill up to 90% of those infected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the current Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea in March, the disease has spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the impact has spread around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cynthia Sangbai-Kwennah, a native of Liberia living in Minnesota, has lost nine family members to Ebola in less than two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Every time you pick up the phone and you receive a call ... this family is dead, this person is dead,\" Sangbai-Kwennah told CNN affiliate WCCO NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First her father perished. Then other relatives who had been taking care of him. Sangbai-Kwennah even lost her younger sister, who had just recently graduated from college. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Your entire family die in a month and a half,\" she said. \"It's just so scary. I'm just so confused. I don't even know what to do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are several experimental drugs and vaccines being created for Ebola, Kieny said, though none has been through the necessary human trials to prove safety and efficacy. And none of them is currently available in unlimited supply. This outbreak, she said, is an opportunity to right a wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The fact that there is no drug for Ebola is a market failure. This is typically a disease of poor people in poor countries where there is no market.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Desperation has pushed Liberia's government to ask for the experimental serum used to treat the Americans and Spanish priest, in order to treat two local doctors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Liberia's request for access to ZMapp, which was created by the San Diego-based biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. Sample doses of the medicine will be sent to Liberia this week to treat doctors who have contracted the virus, the Liberian government said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mapp Biopharmaceutical said Monday that its supply has been exhausted after fulfilling the request of a West African country. (It did not name the country.) Kentucky BioProcessing, which manufactures a version of the drug, is working to increase production of ZMapp, but the process will take several months, company spokesman David Howard said last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are not adequate supplies of any of the investigational agents anywhere near ready for human use,\" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University Medical Center, referring to all drugs being developed to treat Ebola. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not (adequate) to treat all the patients in this outbreak, even if we knew they worked.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions about drug access NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gulf between developed and developing nations appeared to some to widen last week as reports emerged that the Ebola drug was being used to treat Westerners but not West Africans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What if it had killed both of them?\" Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University in Atlanta, said about the two Americans first treated with ZMapp. \"It is only because it worked, seemingly very well, that people are screaming, 'How come people in Africa didn't get it?' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wolpe said that considering the converse situation could provide some perspective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If the first people (to receive doses of ZMapp) would have been Liberian, headlines would have screamed, 'Experimental drug tested on poor Africans,' \" Wolpe said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the nagging question for some: Was giving the serum to Africans even a consideration? Should it have been? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why didn't Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, the chief Sierra Leone physician who died while treating Ebola patients, receive this medication?\" Harriet Washington wrote in a recent CNN Opinion piece . \"Because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a Westerner rather than a resident of the global South.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WHO will convene a panel at the end of the month to discuss who should get priority access to the experimental drugs, Kieny said. WHO will not broker access, she noted, meaning it will not be responsible for doling out doses. It will simply provide information about companies that have quantities available to people or government agencies that are asking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Drug safety concerns NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More relevant than who got what and when, experts say, are questions about the safety of the current crop of experimental Ebola drugs. For ZMapp and other Ebola drugs currently in the pipeline -- like TKM-Ebola by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals -- there are not good, substantive data in humans to support their use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Usually, you treat large numbers of sick people to be sure something isn't going to hurt them,\" said Goodman, former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration. \"So while it seems at first glance that two individuals getting something promising in animals and then improving, is convincing, I don't think it's yet convincing. I think it's hopeful.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wolpe, Washington and Goodman agree that careful study should precede widespread dissemination of any Ebola drug and that Africans should be represented in those studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If (ZMapp) turns out to be as effective as it seems to be, and it's possible to make much more of it, then we end up with a situation where it becomes unethical to withhold treatment,\" Wolpe said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We should do everything we can to nip this epidemic in the bud.\" ||||| MADRID (AP) — In a development that raises a host of ethical issues, Spain announced it had obtained a scarce U.S.-made experimental Ebola drug to treat a Spanish missionary priest infected with the killer virus.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far the experimental drug ZMapp has been used to treat two infected Americans and a Spaniard but no Africans for a hemorrhagic disease that has been ravaging West Africa for months and has killed about 50 percent of those it infects. That news came as medical experts debated the ethical questions surrounding experimental Ebola drugs and vaccines during a teleconference Monday organized by the U.N. health agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no known cure or licensed treatment for Ebola, which has killed over 960 people in the current outbreak in West Africa. The World Health Organization has called the Ebola outbreak — which emerged in Guinea in March and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and possibly Nigeria — an international health emergency and urged nations worldwide to battle the disease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug's maker, Mapp Pharmaceutical Inc. of San Diego, says on its website that \"very little of the drug is currently available\" and that it is cooperating with government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nigerian officials say they had asked U.S. health authorities about getting the Ebola drug last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It certainly looks bad that only three Westerners have gotten the drug while most of the people with Ebola are African,\" said Art Caplan, director of bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. He said the drugmaker must make its policy for distributing its treatment clear. \"I don't think this scarce resource should just be given to whoever is best connected.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Caplan said there might be a reasonable explanation for why only Westerners were given the drug, including the need for a sophisticated medical center to administer it and monitor the patient carefully since the drug hasn't been tested in humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some Africans said giving the experimental drug only to Westerners was patently unfair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's no reason to try this medicine on sick white people and to ignore blacks,\" said Marcel Guilavogui, a pharmacist in Conakry, Guinea. \"We understand that it's a drug that's being tested for the first time and that could have negative side effects. But we have to try it in blacks too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Nigeria, which says it has 10 confirmed cases of Ebola, some people began demanding the serum on Twitter. The World Health Organization has not yet confirmed the Nigerian cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the Spanish Health Ministry said the ZMapp drug was obtained in Geneva this weekend with permission from the company and brought to Madrid to treat Miguel Pajares. The 75-year-old priest was evacuated from Liberia and placed in isolation Thursday at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Americans diagnosed with Ebola in Liberia and evacuated back to the United States have been treated with the drug. One of them, Dr. Kent Brantly, said last week that his condition was improving and the husband of the aid worker being treated with Brantly said the same thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug is made at Kentucky BioProcessing for Mapp Biopharmaceutical. A spokesman for Kentucky BioProcessing said last week that it complied with a request from the international relief group Samaritan's Purse and Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and provided a limited amount of the drug. Brantly works for Samaritan's Purse and both Americans are being cared for now at Emory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not exactly clear how Spain got the drug and authorities refused to comment about any possible costs involved. Geneva University Hospital told The Associated Press it was involved in getting the drug to Spain but would not elaborate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its statement, Spain's Health Ministry said \"the medicine was imported from Geneva where there was one dose available in the context of an accord between the laboratory that developed the medicine, WHO and (Doctors Without Borders).\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It said Spain sought the drug under a Spanish law that permits the use of unauthorized medication for patients with a life-threatening illness who cannot be treated satisfactorily by authorized drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least two countries in West Africa have expressed interest in the drug. Nigeria's health minister, Onyenbuchi Chukwu, said last week he had asked U.S. health officials about access to it but was told the manufacturer would have to agree. Guinea also said Monday it would like to have some of the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Guinean authorities would naturally be interested in having this medicine,\" said Alhoussein Makanera Kake, spokesman for the government committee fighting Ebola. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the ZMapp drug has never been tested in humans, scientists say there's no way to tell if it has made any difference to the two American aid workers who have received it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug is a mixture of three antibodies engineered to recognize Ebola and bind to infected cells so the immune system can kill them. Scientists culled antibodies from laboratory mice and ZMapp's maker now grows the antibodies in tobacco plants and then purifies them. It takes several months to even produce a modest amount of the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.N. health agency planned to hold a news conference Tuesday to discuss the ethics meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other Ebola developments Monday: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — A Catholic humanitarian group based in Spain said that another religious worker and colleague of the infected Spanish priest had died in from Ebola in Liberia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — Nigerian health authorities confirmed another Ebola case Monday, a nurse who had treated Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian-American who flew into Nigeria and died last month. That brings the locally confirmed Ebola cases in Nigeria to 10, including the two who have died, Sawyer and another nurse. Nigerian authorities now have 177 contacts of Sawyer under surveillance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — Liberia announced that a donation of protective gear from China was arriving Monday. A shortage of full-body suits and even clean surgical gloves has left health workers exposed to the virus and prompted some to refuse to treat Ebola patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — George Weah, a former FIFA world player of the year from Liberia, has joined the efforts to spread awareness about the disease and how to prevent it. He recorded a song titled \"Ebola is real,\" and proceeds are going to the Liberian Health Ministry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical writer Cheng reported from London. AP writers Jonathan Paye-Layleh from Monrovia, Liberia, Boubacar Diallo in Gonakry, Guinea and Bashir Adigun from Abuja, Nigeria, also contributed to this report. ||||| Image copyright EPA Image caption Miguel Pajares worked at a hospital in the Liberian capital NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Spanish missionary who contracted the Ebola virus while working in West Africa has died in hospital in Madrid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 1,000 people have died in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the outbreak was first reported in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miguel Pajares, 75, was airlifted back to Spain from Liberia last week with a nun who tested negative for the virus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the past few days he had been treated with an untested, experimental drug, Zmapp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A World Health Organization (WHO) panel in Geneva has meanwhile approved the ethics of using ZMapp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Reuters news agency, the panel said it was ethical to combat the Ebola outbreak by offering drugs or vaccines whose side-effects and efficacy had yet to be proven. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The priest was part of a Catholic order at St Joseph's hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hospital has now been closed because of the outbreak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Congolese nun died there on Saturday, days after its director, Patrick Nshamdze, also died. ||||| The Ebola outbreak in Africa has confronted ethicists and health officials with a terrible dilemma: when a limited amount of an experimental treatment exists, who should get access first? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts are debating whether to use untested drugs in the crisis NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are currently no Ebola treatments on the market. But in this deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, two Americans missionaries received an experimental Ebola drug called ZMapp after getting the disease in Liberia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, infectious disease experts around the world are proclaiming that African Ebola victims should have the same right. In response, both the Obama administration and the World Health Organization set-up expert groups to weigh the moral debates around the more widespread use of untested drugs in what has now been deemed an international health crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make sense of the thorny problems at the heart of this outbreak's morality crisis, we called medical ethicists and doctors. Here are the four questions they say they are grappling with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1) Is it okay to skip the drug testing pathway in a crisis? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In order to get a drug on the market, a rigorous (though admittedly flawed) process has been established. Generally it works like this: first drugs are tested in animals, then in a small group of humans for safety, and if all goes well, testing moves to a larger group of people for efficacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's the path ZMapp drug was on,\" said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the department of medical ethics and health policy at University of Pennsylvania's medical school. \"Now because we have a crisis, we have short-circuited that path on the grounds of compassionate use.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinical Trials Phases from ClinicalTrials.Gov NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety. Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's an open debate about whether this is appropriate: While experimental treatments may offer potential help, they can also be risky because of the lack of testing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ethical argument for skipping the clinical trials process is that patients with a high chance of dying have few alternatives. So sometimes regulators grant them access to treatments outside of the well-worn clinical trials, before they are approved, because their only other alternative is probably death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is reportedly how Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the American missionaries working in West Africa, got access to this very early-stage drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there is another ethical justification for potentially doing harm to a patient in a moment of crisis, said Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to the \"do no harm\" adage, in emergencies, the physician and philosopher Hippocrates advised that medics should \"be bold.\" So, he added: \"There's huge lethality and we don't have much in the way of alternatives, so Hippocrates would have said, 'Let's get in there' (with experimental drugs).\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2) Why did Americans get an experimental drug while hundreds of Africans die of Ebola? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it's not that easy. Giving the drug to the missionaries raised another ethical dilemma: Why did the Americans get to try ZMapp, while Africans did not? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emanuel said this is a common problem that comes up when you skip the clinical trials and drug approvals processes. \"Once you do compassionate use, you invariably create inequalities,\" he explained. \"Some people get it, and other people don't get it, and largely though not exclusively the people who end up getting it are well connected and somehow much better off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the case here: ZMapp is in limited supply in America, created using mostly Department of Defense funding, so Emanuel said he was not surprised that Americans with connections to government were granted access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3) What if the Ebola drug doesn't work? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some have seized on the moment to argue that more experimental Ebola drugs should be rolled out in Africa, which raises another ethical issue: On a societal level, the benefits of rushing ZMapp to patients may not outweigh the harms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right now, all the data we have related to ZMapp are promising monkey studies involving similar drugs (other \"monoclonal antibodies\") but the actual ZMapp experiments in non-human primates has never been published. What's more, no Ebola-fighting monoclonal antibody has ever been tested in humans. So we don't yet know that the drug works. If the Americans live, that may be no indication of ZMapp's efficacy. This strain of Ebola kills around 70 to 80 percent of those who get it, so survival may not necessarily be attributable to any medication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We'll need more robust data than a single experiment involving two people to know whether the Ebola drug ZMapp is safe and effective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We'll need more robust data than a single experiment involving two people to know whether ZMapp is safe and effective. More often than not, promising animal studies lead nowhere, Emanuel cautioned: In cancer therapeutics, for example, for every hundred drugs that work, only three to five end up being useful in humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"First, we need to know whether the drug works, and second what are its side effects,\" said Emanuel. \"Is it an unalloyed good or are there serious side effects to consider?\" With ZMapp, we just don't know. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4) Who should fund access to Ebola medicines? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If an organization like the WHO decided we should give Ebola-endemic areas access to the early-stage therapies that are out there, who will pay to do that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the money for Ebola drug development comes from the US government since the private sector does not generally invest in rare diseases that affect the poor. Calls to speed up the development and scaling of experimental therapies will require the private sector to change its ways and put more money into largely unprofitable business propositions. Or it'll require governments to step up their funding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If governments or industry decide to increase funding to rush Ebola drugs to patients, it'll then come down to how much uncertainty regulators are able to take on. When regulators allowed unapproved drugs on to the market in previous health emergencies (such as the 2009 H1N1 epidemic) they had already been tested in people or they were given out on compassionate use grounds for individual patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's different than saying we're going to make the routine therapy for a disease like Ebola an unapproved drug,\" explained Dr. Dan Bausch, associate professor of tropical medicine at Tulane University. \"There's no precedent for that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Ebola, African subjects would need to be enrolled in a natural experiment, he explained, since they're the ones who would be infected with Ebola. (You wouldn't design a trial that gives people a deadly disease for the sake of science.) Or regulators would need to agree on a protocol and eligibility criteria for offering the unproven Ebola drugs to certain infected patients, and then monitor their recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This change would not happen overnight. \"You'd have to engage local people in the process, get informed consent in their language and in their terms,\" said Moreno. \"Once you've done that, this could take years. If you're a drug company or a government group, what's the commitment to that region or country? You can't just fly in and out.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If I had Ebola, and I was asked, 'Do you want to take this drug?' I would. So we need to explore the best way to improve therapy for people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regulators will weigh these risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis for each of the Ebola drugs in the pipeline. In the background, they'll need to consider the fact that something could go wrong in giving untested drugs to patients. \"There could be legal and political problems. You could be accused of testing and taking advantage of poor people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But whoever invests in Ebola will have ethical reasons for doing so. \"In the 21st century globalization,\" said Moreno, \"there's good reason for us to be worried about an epidemic disease. There's a humanitarian as well as prudential reason for governments to get involved.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Bausch put it more simply: \"If I had Ebola, and I was asked, 'Do you want to take this drug?' I would. So I think we need to explore the best way to improve therapy for people in West Africa and not be hypocritical.\" ||||| Ethical considerations for use of unregistered interventions for Ebola virus disease (EVD) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Summary of the panel discussion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR West Africa is experiencing the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history. Ebola outbreaks can be contained using available interventions like early detection and isolation, contact tracing and monitoring, and adherence to rigorous procedures of infection control. However, a specific treatment or vaccine would be a potent asset to counter the virus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past decade, research efforts have been invested into developing drugs and vaccines for Ebola virus disease. Some of these have shown promising results in the laboratory, but they have not yet been evaluated for safety and efficacy in human beings. The large number of people affected by the 2014 west Africa outbreak, and the high case-fatality rate, have prompted calls to use investigational medical interventions to try to save the lives of patients and to curb the epidemic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Therefore, on 11 August 2014, WHO convened a consultation to consider and assess the ethical implications for clinical decision-making of the potential use of unregistered interventions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the particular circumstances of this outbreak, and provided certain conditions are met, the panel reached consensus that it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ethical criteria must guide the provision of such interventions. These include transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In order to understand the safety and efficacy of these interventions, the group advised that, if and when they are used to treat patients, there is a moral obligation to collect and share all data generated, including from treatments provided for ‘compassionate use’ (access to an unapproved drug outside of a clinical trial). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group explored how the use of these interventions can be evaluated scientifically to ensure timely and accurate information about the safety and efficacy of these investigational interventions. There was unanimous agreement that there is a moral duty to also evaluate these interventions (for treatment or prevention) in the best possible clinical trials under the circumstances in order to definitively prove their safety and efficacy or provide evidence to stop their utilization. Ongoing evaluation should guide future interventions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to this advice, the panel identified areas that need more detailed analysis and discussion, such as: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ethical ways to gather data while striving to provide optimal care under the prevailing circumstances; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ethical criteria to prioritize the use of unregistered experimental therapies and vaccines; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ethical criteria for achieving fair distribution in communities and among countries, in the face of a growing number of possible new interventions, none of which is likely to meet demand in the short term.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group is being formed under Dr. Nicole Lurie, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the Department of Health and Human Services, an administration official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The action follows mounting international pressure as the death toll mounts to consider using untested treatments. The World Health Organization (WHO) is due to consider next week the ethics of administering such drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives, according to the WHO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. group will include scientists and officials from such agencies as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calls to consider making unapproved drugs available to Ebola patients have grown since two U.S. aid workers infected with the deadly virus received an experimental treatment that may have helped them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug, from California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, had only been tested on monkeys. It is one of several being considered for use by people infected with Ebola. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early human clinical trials for a drug from Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceutical Corp had been put on hold by U.S. regulators. On Thursday, the company said the hold had been partially lifted to enable its potential use by infected patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fauci said in an interview that he was not certain when the group would have its first meeting or who would be there, but he said, \"I'm sure they'll tap people from NIAID with competence in clinical trials.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Expertise in clinical trials, in which patients receive an experimental drug under scientifically rigorous conditions, is crucial, Fauci said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You need to balance compassion with the need to figure out if something actually works,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Countless experimental drugs have cured lab animals but failed to work in people or even caused harm. For that reason, Fauci said, \"You can't just willy-nilly give out a drug. You have a responsibility to at least rule out that it is harming people and to make some effort to find out if it works.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If compassion dictates providing experimental compounds to Ebola patients in West Africa, he said, then the way to meet the ethical obligation to determine safety and efficacy is through a clinical trial, such as by giving a drug to 50 Ebola patients in a hospital in Liberia and comparing them to 50 patients who do not get it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That requires adequate supplies of a drug. \"There is an extremely limited supply and in some cases no supply of these drugs that people are reading about,\" Fauci said, referring to media reports about the experimental drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Policymakers need to determine whether there is a way to identify the experimental compounds most likely to help, presumably via lab animal studies, and which could undergo \"accelerated production to introduce in controlled sites and at least begin doing something,\" said J. Stephen Morrison, a global health expert who worked for the U.S. State Department during the Clinton administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate from the Ebola working group, the administration official said the CDC was pursuing a short-term strategy to control the spread of the outbreak by establishing and supporting medical infrastructure in affected countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC's long-term strategy is aimed at preventing future outbreaks.

{"context": "Hello, Peter Berkowitz. Peter Berkowitz As home and apartment prices in San Francisco have skyrocketed, finding an affordable place to live isn't easy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's why 25-year-old illustrator Peter Berkowitz decided to get a little creative with his living situation, constructing an 8-by-3.5-by-4.5 \"bedroom pod\" that costs about $500 a month to live in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He originally planned to split a two-bedroom apartment with a friend, but he quickly realized that, price-wise, he couldn't make it work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was far too optimistic at first that we could find a place that wouldn't cost a fortune,\" Berkowitz tells Business Insider. \"It didn't take long to realize that that wasn't a feasible plan though.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's when Berkowitz decided that he'd construct a pod so that he and his friend could split a one-bedroom instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Two people looking for a one-bedroom apartment makes the city a lot less scary,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though he didn't end up living with that friend, he did move ahead with his pod plan in the living room of another apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Take a peek inside Berkowitz's interesting digs: ||||| Three weeks ago, with the help of friends who had touched power tools before, I started building (with the design mind of Stan Kim and the woodworking smarts of Krakatoa Design) a pod for me to live out of in my friend's living room. It's now pretty much complete. People are typically surprised that I would want to live in a pod, but I think they tend to underestimate how pleasant a pod can be if it's designed smartly. It's the coziest bedroom I've ever had. It's the only bed I've had with a fold-down desk, a slanted + cushioned backboard, and uniformly ideal light for reading (I can read comfortably from anywhere on my bed. This sounds trivial but isn't.). Moreover, I'm now only paying $508 / month to live up the street from the beach in San Francisco ($400 / month is for rent, $108 / month over the course of a year covers the full cost of construction. Building the pod cost $1300 total, $550 excluding up front capital costs). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, living in a pod is silly. But the silliness is endemic to San Francisco's absurdly high housing prices - the pod is just a solution that works for me. Many people have apartments with the space/ capacity to house another person but choose not to because there isn't an attractive way to do so. Temporary partitions offer poor privacy, especially in terms of sound. They also tend to ruin whatever room they're in - you're less likely to use your living room if it doubles as a bedroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think pods can provide a needed fix here. Yes the living room housing my pod is smaller - but it's by no means ruined. If pods can provide an attractive way to add a bedroom to an apartment, I think they could help a lot of people out. People with the extra space wanting to bring in more money by subletting, people looking for cheap and simple housing, or people wanting to add another bedroom so their friend can move in could all benefit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What this all comes back to, though, is making a pod people would be willing to live in - one that doesn't feel like a step down from a bedroom.

Photo: Peter Berkowitz Photo: Peter Berkowitz Image 1 of / 17 Caption Close City of San Francisco says it's illegal to live in a box 1 / 17 Back to Gallery NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, the story of a 25-year-old man who's living inside a plywood box parked in his friend's living room became the latest installment in San Francisco's crazy housing market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a city where the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is currently $3,590, Peter Berkowitz's tale of paying only $400 a month in rent and squeezing into some 32-square-feet of space became the stuff of legend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It fits all my needs where I have a private, sound-proof place where I can keep my belongings,\" Berkowitz said in an interview with SFGate. \"I'm saving thousands of dollars a year. It's a solution that works for me. I don't want to spend so much money on rent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After media outlets across the country covered the story and the London Guardian ran an editorial by Berkowitz, he began hearing from people who wanted to live in similar humble, inexpensive accommodations. Berkowitz announced in a story on Hoodline this week that he would begin selling custom pods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those plans were quickly stopped by the San Francisco's chief housing inspector Rosemary Bosque who told Hoodline that \"pods are illegal and a violation of housing, building, and fire safety codes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He would have to completely open it up or look at something different, such as a bed with a frame, with curtains, something that was open to the room,\" Bosque said in the Hoodline interview. \"This would be the case for anywhere in the country with respect to building and inhabitability codes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As SFGate reported in an earlier story on March 30, 2016, Berkowitz could actually afford to pay more in rent. He's a successful illustrator who has been busy with freelance work ever since one of his cartoons made it into the New Yorker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The thing is that he doesn't want to pour all of his money into high-priced San Francisco rent—and so that's why he came up with the idea for the pod. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Berkowitz moved into his box in early March. He built the structure with friends and the highest quality plywood he could find at Home Depot. The result is a simple box that's eight-feet long, four-and-a-half-feet tall and wide enough to accommodate a twin mattress. The box has a door, windows and a skylight. A desk folds down from the wall and over his lap when he wants to work on his illustrations in bed. Behind the headboard of his bed, there's space for his clothes, which are few. He says he owns only five pairs of pants and three pairs of shoes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, he's finding the accommodations comfortable and says the only thing he'd do differently if he were to rebuild is make the box taller. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: Engineer lived in moving truck in Google parking lot NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Berkowitz was originally looking for a two-bedroom apartment with a friend. \"It only took us a quick visit at Craigslist to realize that it was too expensive,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He got the idea to build a structure that could be moved into an apartment with extra space and started emailing people on Craigslist, but nobody jumped on the opportunity. And then Berkowitz mentioned his plan to a friend living in a three-bedroom apartment with four other roommates and a spacious living room. \"He was excited,\" Berkowitz said. \"And the other roommates liked the idea because they are all now paying less rent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Berkowitz doesn't think his situation is extreme. \"I'm very happy living in this,\" he said. \"I feel like what I'm doing is presented as this extreme action. I'm trying to do something less extreme. The people who are in really extreme situations are living on couches or in partitions.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, \"I've made something beautiful that's a pleasant and serene space to live in. It hasn't changed my life that much. It's very much a comfortable bedroom. In my pod I don't have any roommates. When I had a regular bedroom, I'd spend most of my time on my bed anyway. I have a full apartment I have access to. If I'm going to be reading or doing illustrations, I might come into here to focus.\" ||||| Peter Berkowitz, whose story of living in a wooden box amid San Francisco housing crisis went viral, forced out after city inspectors ruled it a fire hazard NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The San Francisco man who received national attention for living in a wooden box in a friend’s living room violated local housing laws and created a major fire hazard, according to city officials, who have pressured him to take down his pod and move out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Berkowitz’s story went viral after he explained in an op-ed for the Guardian that his solution to the city’s housing crisis was to pay $400 a month to live in a tiny pod that he built in his friend’s place – a semi-private wooden home with enough room for a fold-down desk, a mini bed and a reading light. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That solution, it turns out, was illegal and, according to city inspectors, very dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why I choose to pay $400 to live in a box | Peter Berkowitz Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The housing codes, the fire codes and the building codes are fairly restrictive in terms of what you can do inside, in terms of coming up with another enclosed bedroom,” said William Strawn, director of public affairs for San Francisco’s department of building inspection. “With these types of, what I’ll call creative efforts to try and cope with what everybody recognizes is a tough housing market here, you still have to follow some basic safety … rules.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Building officials recently told the website Hoodline that the pods are illegal and that the city is trying to discourage others from building these types of makeshift bedrooms – even if it has become increasingly difficult to find affordable housing in the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a short interview on Tuesday, Berkowitz said that as soon as he heard the city had worries about his housing set-up, he decided to leave the box. “I’m 100% concerned with doing this legally,” he said. “It is not set up any more.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was staying with family while he’s “figuring things out”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Berkowitz declined to comment on whether he hopes to build a box that meets the city’s code requirements.

Photograph: Peter Berkowitz NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is $3,590, according to real estate website Zumper, and with rents continuing to climb in surrounding Bay Area cities, finding a reasonably priced home throughout the region has become seemingly impossible for some. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, Bay Area residents have resorted to tents, trucks, cupboards under the stairs, basement crawl spaces and other housing scenarios. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strawn said that as soon as building officials saw Berkowitz’s photos online, they tried to track him down to let him know that his box was a hazard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If there were a fire in the building,” he said, “it could go up in a hurry. Anybody inside it would essentially be toast.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strawn said there are state and local codes that govern how much space, air, light and other factors are required in bedrooms. “Based on what we could see from the pictures, that pod would fail all of those tests.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strawn said the city was not able to find Berkowitz and would have delivered a violation notice to the owner if officials had located his address. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He could have a bed with a curtain around it, but it could not be boxed in, so to speak,” he said. ||||| Outer Sunset resident and illustrator Peter Berkowitz became Internet-famous last week when a story about his life in a custom housing \"pod\" in his friend's living room, where he pays $400 per month, went viral. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Berkowitz admits he could afford to pay more, the DIY hack has saved him thousands in rent in a city where the median rent for a one-bedroom is now $3,500. Even in the Outer Sunset, traditionally thought to be less expensive than the rest of San Francisco, the average rent is $2,400 a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an op-ed for the Guardian titled \"Why I choose to pay $400 to live in a box,\" Berkowitz wrote, \"When you live in a city with a housing crisis, like I do, you have to be creative about how to reduce the rent ... I love the pod we’ve built. As I see it, I have all the essentials and then some; privacy, a comfortable place to work due to a fold-down desk, perfect light for reading and a tastefully calm place to be in.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, it looks like Berkowitz, who built the original pod with designer Stan Kim, woodworker Jeff Goodwin and others, is expanding his horizons beyond illustration, offering custom pods for sale on Craigslist for people who want to make money with AirBnB or have their own subletters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike*, an Outer Sunset resident who has a room available on Craigslist during the summer while his family is traveling, says that he received this note from Berkowitz after posting his listing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'm Peter, I'm an illustrator, and I was recently a little bit in the news for living in a pod in an apartment in San Francisco. (You can also read about it on my website.) Essentially, and this is a bit of a weird ask, I'm wondering if you might be interested in having a pod set up (free of charge) in your apartment to enable you to make money from either subletters or Airbnbers. And if it doesn't end up working, I'd also come and take the pod away, again, free of charge. Also, I would help you find subletters or Airbnbers - a lot of people have emailed me who are interested in living in such a situation. Last, I'm very much willing/excited to customize the pod/bed to make something beautiful and functional in your space. (Of course, this wouldn't be charity - as I'm thinking now, I'd take care of the payment with the subletter and in turn send you a check monthly, taking some cut. All of this is open to discussion though.) Thanks so much, feel free to get in touch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Mike decided against taking Berkowitz up on the offer. “No way I would answer him,” he told Hoodline. “Not only I'm pretty sure the pod thing is illegal, but I'm not contributing to that trend. ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’ve reached out to Berkowitz for comment on his new business idea, but as of press time, he has not yet responded. We’ll update when we find out more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update, 4/7: The Department of Building Inspection reached out to Hoodline, confirming that the pods are illegal and a violation of housing, building, and fire safety codes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He wanted to know how he could make it legal,\" said chief housing inspector Rosemary Bosque, who had spoken to Berkowitz roughly a week ago. \"He would have to completely open it up or look at something different, such as a bed with a frame, with curtains, something that was open to the room. This would be the case for anywhere in the country with respect to building and inhabitability codes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're concerned that Mr. Berkowitz is going out and trying to increase the number of these, knowing that this is an at-risk type of thing to do,\" said DBI's legislative and public affairs manager, William Strawn. \"It's not just a matter of high rents and a matter of how people are coping with rents in San Francisco; there are fire safety realities.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was just trying to gauge interest from people nearby,\" Berkowitz told us in response. \"I am not moving forward with anything I outlined in that email.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *Name has been changed."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The departure of some of the group’s leadership does not mean that the battle to take Raqqa will be easy, the official said. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 fighters remain in the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To provide more firepower for the looming battle, a United States Marine artillery unit is being deployed in Syria, mimicking the approach the United States has taken to support Iraqi troops fighting to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the flight of some Islamic State leaders indicates that their loss of Raqqa would not signal the end of their struggle to preserve their pseudo-state. The group’s fighters are expected to fight on in Deir al-Zour, a Syrian province south of Raqqa, and in Iraqi towns along the Euphrates River, as well as to try to administer their self-proclaimed caliphate from those places. ||||| A detachment of U.S Marines arrived in Syria outside the ISIS de-facto capital of Raqqa, a U.S. defense official confirmed Wednesday to Fox News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pentagon is not publically confirming the move, citing operational security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The recent deployment is expected to be discussed Thursday when the head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Joe Votel, the top U.S. general responsible for American forces in the Middle East, appears before Congress to testify on the ISIS fight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Votel had hinted that more troops would be headed to Syria along with artillary when he spoke to reporters while traveling in the region late last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. is authorized to have up to 500 troops in Syria. Before the Marines arrived, roughly 300 U.S. special operations personnel were supporting local Syrian forces there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, the U.S. is preparing to send hundreds of U.S. troops to Kuwait in order to be ready to join the Islamic State fight if they are needed, the official said. The number would be fewer than 1,000, the official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Washington Post was first to report on the deployment of Marines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate defense officials told the newspaper the group of Marines are working to establish an outpost from which they can fire artillery guns in support of the fight to take back Raqqa from ISIS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pentagon leaders sent a new plan to defeat ISIS to the White House late last month. It outlined a strategy that would likely increase the number of U.S. troops in Syria in order to better advise and enable the U.S.-backed Syrian fighters who will take on the battle for Raqqa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials say the battle for Raqqa will look much like the fight in neighboring Iraq, where local forces are in a fierce battle to retake the northern city of Mosul from ISIS. As troops were preparing to move into Mosul, the U.S. set up bases outside the city to use as logistical hubs and as locations for heavy artillery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The moves to pre-position U.S. troops closer to the fight, so they can be tapped as needed, are the kinds of decisions that military commanders say they need to be able to make more quickly, without going to the White House every time for approval.

{"context": "An Immigrant who has sought sanctuary in a Center City Philadelphia church for the past year in fear of being deported has now gained legal status and returned home this morning, to his own sanctuary. NBC10's Pamela Osborne was there when Javier Flores Garcia left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the watchful eye of William Penn near Philadelphia City Hall, Javier Flores Garcia stepped into fresh air for the first time in almost 11 months Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was painful watching parents with their kids walk around here and not be able to do the same,” he said. “It’s very hard and very difficult.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 40-year-old undocumented immigrant found sanctuary at the United Methodist Church on Broad and Arch streets shortly after President Donald Trump was elected to office. It was a form of resistance, but also an attempt to protect his family by remaining close enough to still see them and be a part of their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “True liberation is rooted in love. This is a love story,” the Rev. Robin Hynicka, senior pastor at the church, said. “It’s traumatic to see him go. But it’s more traumatic to see him detained and separated from his family.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flores has lived in Philadelphia on and off since 1997. He has been caught several times crossing into the United States from his native Puebla, the Mexican state recently ravaged by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake. On a few of those occasions, he voluntarily turned around but always came back to reunite with his wife and three children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also has a driving under the influence conviction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2004, the former landscaper was stabbed by two men carrying boxcutters and left for dead in Bensalem. While in the hospital, he helped local officials track down and prosecute his attackers. Because of his help and otherwise good standing in the community, his deportation orders were dropped, Flores’ lawyer, Brennan Gian-Grasso, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flores is now eligible for a U Visa, which grants temporary status to victims of crime who help authorities investigate and prosecute. After leaving the church Wednesday, he went to the immigration office to have his ankle monitor removed and to begin the process of gaining temporary status. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He can get a work permit and be with his family now,\" Gian-Grasso said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flores' release coincided with Trump’s visit to Pennsylvania. He will appear Wednesday evening alongside U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, the former mayor of Hazleton who tried to introduce an anti-immigrant ordinance during his tenure. His act making English the official language and fining businesses that hired undocumented workers was ruled unconstitutional after a lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney has repeatedly challenged the Trump administration’s immigration policy, declaring the city a sanctuary and refusing to ask police to volunteer the immigration status of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, the city sued U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the rights of sanctuary cities. Philadelphia hopes to prevent Sessions from imposing new and “unprecedented” requirements on grant funds as a backlash to the city's leniency toward undocumented immigrants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The mayor is very happy for Javier and his family,” Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Mayor Jim Kenney, said. “It doesn’t make any sense we have an immigration policy that would tear families apart and force hard-working people out.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenney and Flores have met at the church on at least one occasion, Hitt said. They will likely meet again when Flores’ immigration process is complete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, clergy members called Flores “a citizen of the world.” He spent his time painting, fixing odds and ends and cooking in the church kitchen while living there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He first met advocates from immigrant rights group Juntos while Pope Francis visited Philadelphia in 2015. At that time, Flores was in the midst of being held at the York County and Pike County detention centers, where he was detained for 16 months. His daughter, now 12, held a sign that read “Help Us Father.” The pope stopped to bless her, the family said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juntos helped Flores find legal representation and also seek medical attention for his children, some of whom were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing their father’s ordeal, Gian-Grasso said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When you see the kids’ faces, there is no way you can say no,” Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, said. “What this [outcome] means is resistance works. This is a day to celebrate freedom.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flores has been granted deferred status, which means he can live and work in the U.S. and continue to apply for visas. His current designation prevents Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials from arresting him at a time when raids are sweeping the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recently, 107 undocumented immigrants were arrested in Pennsylvania. More than 20 percent were in Philadelphia, the city with the most arrests. Los Angeles was second with 101 arrests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those arrested in Philadelphia was a citizen of the Dominican Republic who entered the country illegally and had previous convictions for possession of firearms, ICE said. The 498 people arrested in the national operation came from 42 countries and 312 of them had criminal convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the threat of more ICE actions lingering, having a temporary reprieve feels like a blessing, Flores said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have to say to everyone in a similar situation as me, ‘Keep fighting, because after the torment comes peace,’” he said. ||||| The U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act) in October 2000. The legislation was intended to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens and other crimes, while also protecting victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse due to the crime and are willing to help law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity.

He was the first in the country to go into sanctuary under the Trump administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was just after 10 a.m. when Javier Flores Garcia walked out of the Arch Street Methodist Church breathing his first breaths of city air and hugging his two young sons and daughter as a free man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia thanked his lawyers. He had been deported three times before and ended up in the Berks Detention Center. When he was released last year for three months, he went into sanctuary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia was stabbed in 2004 and helped police nab the suspect, qualifying him for a special visa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He received something called deferred action,” said attorney Brennan Gian-Grasso. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gian-Grasso says after multiple appeals, Garcia’s U-visa application was approved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garcia could get his visa as early as next year, but first he’ll celebrate. Immigration and Customs Enforcement generally will not enter churches, making them ideal locations for sanctuary. ||||| His stay in sanctuary was among the longest, but given that President Barack Obama also made extensive use of deportations, there are two other people still taking refuge after more than a year and a half. At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Andersen said, one woman from Guatemala who took refuge in July in a Pentecostal church in New Haven had her immigration case resolved in less than a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week, churches in Raleigh, N.C.; Meriden, Conn.; and Highland Park, N.J., announced that they were offering sanctuary to a total of four people. The New Jersey church took in a couple who say they could face persecution for their Christian faith if they were deported back to Indonesia. It is their second time in sanctuary in the same church, according to the pastor, Seth Kaper-Dale, an immigration activist who is now running for governor on the Green Party ticket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is the policy of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that churches, schools and hospitals are “sensitive locations” where immigration officers are not supposed to make arrests except in extraordinary circumstances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, the “sensitive locations enforcement policy has not changed” under President Trump, said Jennifer Elzea, the agency’s acting press secretary: “I’ve not been aware of any instances in which we’ve entered a church or place of worship to conduct enforcement actions.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Flores took sanctuary last November at the Arch Street United Methodist Church, one day before he was supposed to report for deportation back to Mexico. He had been living in the United States on and off since 1997, and had been caught nine times trying to cross the border illegally, immigration officials said. Mr. Flores said he had compelling reasons for doing so: A longtime partner, Alma Lopez, their two sons, and Ms. Lopez’s teenage daughter, whom he considers his stepdaughter, all lived in the United States. Mr. Flores supported them by working as an arborist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve never brought drugs, I’ve never helped anybody else cross the border — my only crime is coming back,” Mr. Flores said in an interview in the church last December. “I came here for the love of my children.”"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bronx state Sen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The photo and story worry me as a Senator, a Minister, a parent, and a grandfather, because I believe that the disregard for any boundaries of sexual activity with a child present is incredibly inappropriate, and could have a harmful impact on the child.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said, “I urge the City of New York’s Administration for Children’s Services to investigate this case carefully and thoroughly … I am sure that the Administration for Children’s Services will consider how Anthony Weiner’s continued perverted activity that we have all seen over the years in his texting or Twittering is a harbinger of possible future child abuse or neglect, especially when he does this with his child next to him in his bed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diaz said there should no double standard when it comes to child abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am pretty sure that if this kind of information was shared with the public and if the adult in the photo with a toddler was Black or Hispanic, the City of New York’s Administration for Children’s Services would have been knocking on the door to investigate possible child abuse to remove the child.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diaz called Weiner’s perversion “a very sad situation” and said he would pray for both parents to “acknowledge the harmful effect of this continue activity on their young child, and they will address it with professional help before their child is further victimized by it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The table is now set for a type of custody case that could go on longer than these two have been married and in an environment that is as ugly as any one’s imagination can bring to bear,” predicts Manhattan divorce attorney Bernard Clair, who represented Jason Hoppy in his contentious split from reality TV star Bethenny Frankel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If Woody Allen wrote this into a movie nobody would believe him,” added celebrity divorce lawyer Raoul Felder.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clair says he expects a bitter custody battle because neither Weiner nor his now-estranged wife, top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, are ideal parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A judge would have to weigh, “Huma’s unavailability and heavy, out-of-the-home commitments versus a father who appears to lack every kind of parental judgement,” Clair says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One would certainly begin to be curious about what his problem are and how would they manifest themselves while he’s in the presence of a child,” Stutman said.

{"context": "– Sen. Al Franken plans to stay in the U.S. Senate and try to win back Minnesotans’ trust. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Minnesota Democrat, who has been accused by four women — two of them anonymously — of inappropriate contact, issued a Thanksgiving afternoon apology and pledge. He wrote that he “feels terribly that I’ve made some women feel badly.” He called himself “a warm person” who likes to hug people when they’re being photographed with him, but clearly, his embrace “crossed a line for some women.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although his statement did not directly address the question of whether he might resign, he vowed to move ahead with an effort to regain the trust of his constituents. A spokesman for Franken said Thursday that the senator has no plans to resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The accusations, which have left Franken facing a Senate ethics investigation, have touched off a fierce debate among his progressive supporters over what level of sexual misconduct should force a politician with a record of support for women’s rights to resign from office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Because he happens to be a good guy on some other issues, people are confused,” said Erin Vilardi, head of VoteRunLead, a national group that aims to elect more women to public office. It held a national convention in Minneapolis last weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vilardi spoke after the first two accusations against Franken and before Wednesday’s Huffington Post report of the third and fourth allegations. The website cited two unidentified women who said he grabbed their buttocks in separate incidents. Each spoke on condition of anonymity about events they said occurred during Franken’s first Senate run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first said Franken groped her when he posed for a photo with her after a June 2007 event hosted by the Minnesota Women’s Political Caucus in Minneapolis. The second told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The accusations against Franken have emerged in a charged atmosphere of accusations and denials in a broad swath of American life — politics, the arts, media and business. In Minnesota, accusations by several women against state Sen. Dan Schoen, a DFLer, and state Rep. Tony Cornish, a Republican, led both to say they’ll resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first accusation against Franken came last week, when Los Angeles radio broadcaster Leeann Tweeden tweeted that he forcibly kissed and groped her during a 2006 USO tour. He apologized to her but added that he remembered their encounter differently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On that same tour, the former “Saturday Night Live” cast member also mugged for a photo with his hands hovering over Tweeden’s breasts as she slept. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, a second woman accused Franken of unwanted sexual touching. Lindsay Menz, 33, contacted CNN to say that Franken grabbed her buttocks while they posed together for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Menz now lives in Texas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Franken told CNN that he did not remember posing for the photo with Menz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I take thousands of photos at the State Fair surrounded by hundreds of people, and I certainly don’t remember taking this picture. I feel badly that Ms. Menz came away from our interaction feeling disrespected,” Franken said in a statement to CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking after the Tweeden and Menz accusations, Vilardi described participants at the VoteRunLead convention as torn over what to think about Franken. Just because women know a man in one light, she said, that “doesn’t make it impossible that they’ve treated other women like crap.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Democrats and progressives have argued that other politicians, including President Donald Trump and Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, have been accused of worse misconduct. More than 50 women who worked with Franken have spoken out in support of him, saying he treated them with respect at workplaces ranging from the Senate to the “SNL” soundstage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Minnesota Republicans have jumped on the allegations. Jennifer DeJournett, a GOP activist, started a petition demanding his resignation after the first allegation. Signatures spiked further after the other accusations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Franken were to step down, Gov. Mark Dayton would appoint a temporary replacement, and a special election would be held next November for his seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘I crossed a line ...’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Thursday evening’s statement, the senator wrote: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations. I’m a warm person; I hug people. I’ve learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate, and I respect their feelings about that. I’ve thought a lot in recent days about how that could happen, and recognize that I need to be much more careful and sensitive in these situations. I feel terribly that I’ve made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And let me say again to Minnesotans that I’m sorry for putting them through this and I’m committed to regaining their trust.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman said Franken will speak with the media on Sunday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The $244 million test does not necessarily confirm that the American military is capable of defending itself against an intercontinental-range missile fired by North Korea.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee told The Perspective, the College of New Jersey’s student magazine, that it’s not his place to tell someone how to live, but he argued against the legitimacy of civil unions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a real level of being disingenuous on the part of the gay and lesbian community,” he said. \"That would be like saying, well there's there are a lot of people who like to use drugs so let's go ahead and accommodate those who want to use drugs. There are some people who believe in incest, so we should accommodate them. There are people who believe in polygamy, should we accommodate them? ... Who gives you the right to say that a Polygamist is not just as right in his argument as is the person who wants same sex [marriage]?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former GOP presidential candidate also spoke out strongly against gay adoption. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is not about trying to create statements for people who want to change again the basic fundamental definitions of family,” he said. “Children are not puppies. This is not a time to see if we can experiment and find out how does this work?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee isn’t new to such controversy. When running for the Senate in 1992, he wrote in a questionnaire for the Associated Press that homosexuality is “aberrant, unnatural, and sinful lifestyle.” He said that AIDS research was receiving too much money and that celebrities should pay for it rather than the federal government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As governor, Huckabee supported a policy that kept same-sex couples from becoming foster parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee hasn’t been shy about his views on gay marriage, but he said the college newspaper “grossly distorted” them when it published the interview on April 9. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The young college student hopefully will find a career other than journalism,” Huckabee wrote on his web site. “Not only did he attempt to sensationalize my well known and hardly unusual views of same-sex marriage, he also inaccurately reported my views on Michael Steele as GOP chairman - I offered my support and didn't ‘Rip into Steele’ as his article asserted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On whether the embattled RNC chairman should resign, Huckabee told the student reporter it’s up to RNC members, but that “It’s indefensible the way some of the money has been spent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Tracy, editor-in-chief of The Perspective, defended the publication and blasted Huckabee for resorting to “ad hominem attacks.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Politicians in damage-control mode often stoop to attacking the media so they might avoid being accountable for the substance of their remarks,” Tracy wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do you think Huckabee’s statements were blown out of context? Listen to the audio of parts of the interview posted by The Perspective: ||||| Huckabee Rips Steele, Romney, LGBT Activists NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calls Romney’s Healthcare Plan “Dismal Failure,” Compares Same-Sex Marriage to Incest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By M.C. TRACEY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: PERSPECTIVE RESPONDS TO HUCKABEE CLAIM THAT HIS VIEWS WERE ‘GROSSLY DISTORTED’ IN ARTICLE (4.13.10) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview Wednesday, former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee weighed in on embattled Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, slammed his potential 2012 presidential primary rival Mitt Romney, and reiterated strong opposition to same-sex marriage and the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The popular Fox News host, who appeared at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, NJ, leveled into Steele for his handling of last week’s revelation that RNC officials spent donor money at a bondage-themed Los Angeles strip club. “I think what’s happened is horrible,” Huckabee said. “The question is, how is [Steele] going to take control and how is he going to explain it? I think there does need to be a better explanation than what’s come forth so far,” he continued. “It’s been pretty weak.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee said ongoing controversies involving Steele may become an electoral liability for Republicans as this year’s midterm elections approach. “It’s indefensible the way that some of the money has been spent,” Huckabee said, though he declined to call for Steele’s resignation. “Whether he should resign really is a question for the RNC, and I’m not a member, so I’m not going to get into that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee also blasted fellow presidential aspirant Mitt Romney, who as governor of Massachusetts signed into law a healthcare plan that closely resembles Congress’ recently passed reforms. “Essentially ‘Obamacare’ and what Massachusetts has is virtually identical,” Huckabee said, characterizing the system Romney supported as a “dismal failure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s resulted in huge cost increases, exponentially beyond what was projected,” he charged. Romney’s inconsistent public comments on the matter, Huckabee continued, is likely to be a concern for Republican primary voters in 2012. “On one hand, [Romney] said the Massachusetts plan is not like the Obama plan. Then I heard him say, ‘Well, it’s similar, but we’ve learned a lot from it since then.’ So he’s going to have to come up with one answer that deals with it,” Huckabee said. “I think he’s got to make the explanation as to why he believed it was a great idea.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher, remains in favor of keeping in place ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,’ the policy that requires the military to expel openly gay service members. “I wouldn’t support a repeal if I were commander-in-chief,” he said. “You don’t see foot soldiers out there demanding it. I’m not sure that’s the most important thing we ought to be doing for the military.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “[‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell’] touches an extraordinarily small group of people,” Huckabee continued. He dismissed calls to amend the policy as “primarily a posturing point for political purposes,” and an attempt to “force something on the military that they themselves haven’t pushed that hard.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think we certainly should be very sensitive to the fact that the purpose of the military is not to see if we can create social experiments,” Huckabee warned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He continues to oppose any government recognition of same-sex relationships. Even civil unions are “not necessary,” Huckabee said. “I think there’s been a real level of being disingenuous on the part of the gay and lesbian community with their goal of civil unions,” he alleged, referring to LGBT activists who first claimed that their goal in several states was to enact civil unions, but subsequently launched efforts to implement full marriage rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huckabee went on to draw parallels between homosexuality and other lifestyles that are considered by some to be morally aberrant. “You don’t go ahead and accommodate every behavioral pattern that is against the ideal,” he said of same-sex marriage. “That would be like saying, well, there are a lot of people who like to use drugs, so let’s go ahead and accommodate those who want to use drugs. There are some people who believe in incest, so we should accommodate them. There are people who believe in polygamy, so we should accommodate them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also affirmed support for a law in Arkansas that prohibits same-sex couples from becoming adoptive or foster parents. “I think this is not about trying to create statements for people who want to change the basic fundamental definitions of family,” Huckabee said. “And always we should act in the best interest of the children, not in the seeming interest of the adults.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Children are not puppies,” he continued. “This is not a time to see if we can experiment and find out, how does this work?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In what may come as a surprise for some, Huckabee agreed that an atheist could be fit to serve as president. “I’d rather have an honest atheist than a dishonest religious person,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s better to have a person who says, ‘Look, I just don’t believe, and that’s where my honest position happens to be,’” he said. “I’m frankly more OK with that than a person who says, ‘Oh, I am very much a Christian. I very much love God.’ And then they live as if they are atheists, as if they have no moral groundings at all. That’s more troubling.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think it’s nice if a person believes in God,” Huckabee said. “I’d hate to think somebody was making decisions who thought that he couldn’t be higher than himself.”"}

For nearly five decades the school has been the sole supplier of marijuana for U.S. scientists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Institute on Drug Abuse, which holds a monopoly on growing marijuana for federally approved research, is preparing to accept bids for a 12-acre pot farm contract. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The contract is currently held by the University of Mississippi, which since 1968 has been the sole U.S. provider of marijuana for scientific and medical researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NIDA, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, grows the plant and doles it out in cooperation with the school under the supervision of the Drug Enforcement Administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A NIDA spokeswoman tells U.S. News the bidding process is open, and that the University of Mississippi is not a shoo-in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [RELATED: DEA Ratifies Spike In Marijuana for Research] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Lyle Craker, a University of Massachusetts Amherst plant scientist who struggled for years to gain permission to grow marijuana for research, says it’s unlikely anyone else stands a chance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They do this every five years,\" Craker says. \"If I thought there was any chance at all we would apply. Do I think there’s any chance at all? No.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2007 Craker won the endorsement of DEA Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner for his proposal to open a second stream of pot for research, but the DEA’s then-Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart spiked the idea days before President Barack Obama’s inauguration. Obama later appointed Leonhart to be administrator, a job she currently holds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Craker says he hopes commercial growers in states that have legalized recreational or medical marijuana will submit bids, but he’s not optimistic about their chances so long as Leonhart - a loud opponent of liberalizing marijuana laws - is in charge of the DEA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [WATCH: McCain Says 'Maybe We Should Legalize' Pot] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When you’re fighting against a monopoly its very difficult to crack that monopoly,” he says. “As long as Leonhart is head of the DEA it’s not going to happen.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to 12 acres of outdoor growing space, bidders must have a 1,000 square foot indoor growing facility and back-up facilities in case of an emergency. Likely narrowing the pool, applicants must have DEA registration for Schedule II drugs and be eligible for DEA registration for Schedule I substances - the stratum for dangerous drugs with no established medical value. Marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin and ecstasy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The contract also requires testing of marijuana seized by the DEA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The amount of marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi has fluctuated in recent years. From 2005 to 2009 the DEA-established quota was about 9,920 pounds. The annual quota dropped to 46.3 pounds in 2010 before spiking to 1,433 pounds this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [READ: Obama Confused About His Power to Reschedule Pot] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NIDA did not respond to a request for information on the annual variation, but an agency official told the Washington Post in May marijuana is currently going to 100 studies, of which 30 are probing the drug’s therapeutic effects.

{"context": "As federal officials began formal preparations for a government shutdown, House and Senate leaders struggled Monday to reach agreement over tens of billions of dollars in spending cuts that would avert the federal work stoppage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of negotiating over money, time is now also a major concern. There is general agreement that the two sides must work out a deal by Tuesday night if it is to work its way through both chambers and reach President Obama’s desk before the government runs out of money Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late Monday, a senior White House aide told top agency officials to begin preparations for how to handle a shutdown, a move that was echoed in a statement by Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to House leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Boehner also announced his intention to offer Obama and Senate Democrats another stopgap funding measure that would keep federal funding flowing for an additional week. That offer would come with conditions, however: According to the House Appropriations Committee, Democrats would have to agree to $12 billion in further spending cuts and to fund the Defense Department for the remainder of the year — thus removing the Pentagon from the possible budget disruptions still faced by other federal agencies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Short of a broad deal for the entire federal government, approving another short-term measure may be the only route to keep Washington open while the two sides work out their differences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Democrats and Republicans have said they would not approve what would be the seventh stopgap funding bill since October, but some key conservative lawmakers said Monday that they would support one week’s funding if the bill included the Pentagon’s yearly spending. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has been pleading with Congress to exempt his department from the piecemeal plans for funding the government a few weeks at a time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If lawmakers cannot reach an agreement, the first federal government shutdown since the mid-1990s would start Saturday and the full impact would be felt on Monday, when millions of federal employees across the country would typically report for work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the deadline neared, Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) exchanged insults, each side blaming the other for the stalemate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner continued to deny that he had agreed to a widely reported compromise with Democrats of $33 billion in spending reductions — even as one of his GOP chairmen worked with Democrats to hit that mark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Despite attempts by Democrats to lock in a number among themselves, I’ve made clear that their $33 billion is not enough, and many of the cuts that the White House and Senate Democrats are talking about are full of smoke and mirrors. That’s unacceptable,” Boehner said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking on the Senate floor, Reid insisted that “we agreed upon a number.” He accused Boehner of backing away from the compromise because of pressure from tea party activists who provided much of the energy in the GOP’s massive victory in the 2010 elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many conservative Republicans in the House have said they would not vote for any budget deal unless it contained the full $61 billion in cuts GOP members approved earlier this year in a party-line vote. That measure was later rejected by the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Republicans and the tea party continue to reject reality, and insist instead on ideology,” Reid said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At issue, according to aides familiar with the talks, is the makeup of the spending cuts. Democrats want to reach the $33 billion through a combination of permanent cuts to a number of federal agencies and one-time reductions to other government programs, such as Pell grants and some agriculture subsidies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans are balking at many of the temporary cuts because they will not permanently reduce the size of government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if the chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees can agree on a package of cuts, and conservative House members decide to go along with the plan, there may not be enough time to approve it before the deadline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a House rule Boehner put in place this year, no bill can come to a vote until members have had three days to read it — leaving almost no time for the Senate to act if the House could not approve its version until late Friday or over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House Republicans huddled late Monday and, according to a GOP aide, gave the speaker an ovation when he informed them that he was advising the House Administration Committee to begin preparing for a possible shutdown. That process includes alerting lawmakers and senior staff about which employees would not report to work if no agreement is reached. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner’s offer of another stopgap bill comes at a significantly higher cost than the $2 billion in cuts per week that accompanied the two most recent short-term funding plans. Also, Republicans are attaching some policy prescriptions to the one-week measure, including one that would prohibit federal funds going toward any abortion services in the District. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue will come to a head Tuesday at a White House gathering of Obama, Boehner, Reid, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The president has made clear that we all understand the need to cut spending, and significant progress has been made in agreeing that we can all work off the same number,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans and Democrats are eager to avoid a shutdown in part because neither side thinks it will be able to claim political advantage. In a new Washington Post poll, 37 percent say they would fault the Obama administration for a partial federal shutdown. The same number would blame the Republicans in Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those figures are nearly the same as in late February, despite five weeks of fierce negotiations and positioning on the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a change from the government shutdowns in the mid-1990s. In late 1995, 46 percent of voters said they would blame then House speaker, Newt Gin­grich (R-Ga.), if the government shut down, and 27 percent would blame President Bill Clinton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new numbers also indicate growing disillusionment among Republicans. While 81 percent of Republicans say they think Obama is “just playing politics” with the budget (up from 70 percent five weeks ago), 40 percent of all Republicans see the GOP in Congress as posturing on the budget — a 13-point increase.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We heard what sounded like strong wind or a river outside our door,\" she said. Video he shot showed water running right around their house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In case they couldn't later, they decided to evacuate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's funny the things you think are important. In that moment, it was our dog, I grabbed my birth certificate, and a couple of our stuffed animals from our childhood, and that was the only thing that seemed important at the moment -- just us and a couple of sweet things,\" said Cerelli. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outside of their home is a mess, but the structure itself is in pretty good shape, Ferenc said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others weren't so lucky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Colorado Office of Emergency Management, the floods have destroyed 1,502 residential structures and damaged 17,494. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They have also been blamed for as many as six deaths, counting two people presumed to have been killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four confirmed deaths include a man and a woman, both 19, who were swept away after leaving their car Thursday in Boulder County. Authorities said the woman left the car first, and the man jumped out to try to save her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another body was found in a collapsed home in Jamestown in the same county. Rescuers recovered a fourth body on a roadway in Colorado Springs in El Paso County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those presumed dead include a 60-year-old woman and an 80-year-old woman, both in Larimer County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses saw the younger woman swept away by floodwater that demolished her house. The older woman suffered injuries and was unable to leave her home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An additional 482 people remained unaccounted for in Larimer County and 318 in Boulder County. Authorities believe most or all of those people are safe but simply out of touch with relatives or officers who found their homes empty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are taking this stuff back' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the devastation, Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith told reporters Sunday that some of what he's seen has restored his hope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The roads and homes might be gone, he said, but \"inch by inch, mile by mile, community by community, they are taking this stuff back.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith spoke of firefighters who pulled signs out of the mud and residents using their ATVs to rescue neighbors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He recalled \"hearty people\" who didn't wait for officials to reach them but who are \"finding roads out.\" He said he'd heard reports of people hiking out of canyons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, rescues in hard-to-reach areas have taken extraordinary measures. On Saturday a Chinook helicopter piloted by the Colorado National Guard picked up 78 children who got stranded while on a field trip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith's hopeful tone was echoed by Boulder native Jake Koplen. His family nearly evacuated as floodwater surrounded his home. He snapped photos of the scene and posted them to CNN's iReport NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now his family is beginning the slow work of cleaning up. But they won't do it alone. Koplen says his phone has been ringing non-stop with offers of food and assistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, authorities worry that any additional water on ground that's already soaked by up to 15 inches of rain will cause more flooding and dislodge mud and debris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith said he couldn't begin to estimate the scope of the damage. \"I've known these areas for 25 years,\" he said \"I don't recognize some of them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damage worth millions NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boulder County alone will need an estimated $150 million to repair 100 to 150 miles of roadway and 20 to 30 bridges, county transportation director George Gerstle said. The repair bill will be \"10 to 15 times our annual budget,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A helicopter surveillance mission Saturday carrying Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and members of Colorado's congressional delegation was diverted twice to pick up people waving to be rescued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the officials' delayed arrival at a Boulder airport, U.S. Sen. Mark Udall promised a bipartisan push in Congress for federal aid for flood recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for Colorado on Sunday and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Boulder County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hickenlooper said he spoke by phone with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who \"was adamant that the $5 million that was released Friday was just the beginning\" of federal assistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're going to come back and rebuild better than it was before,\" the governor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already some are doing their own math. Barb Vacek doesn't know the dollar amount but she's taken stock of the emotional cost. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family is exhausted, their home and many of their mementos, gone. \"I did lose my family slides from my parents who are deceased,\" she said. \"I was the person entrusted with them, so my childhood is wiped out.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right now, she says, her guilt outweighs her grief. ||||| A road crew works on a stretch of highway washed out by flooding along the South Platte River in Weld County, Colorado near Greeley, Saturday, Sept. 14, 2013. Hundreds of roads in the area have been... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rescue teams are warning people in some Colorado towns isolated by devastating flooding against remaining there, telling them that they could face weeks without basic supplies, including running water and electricity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Helicopters and truck convoys of the National Guard carried the admonition Saturday into paralyzed canyon communities where thousands of stranded residents were eager to escape the Rocky Mountain foothills. But not everybody was willing to go. Dozens of people in hard hit Jamestown wanted to stay to watch over their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities made clear that residents who chose not to leave might not get another chance for a while. Rescuers won't go back for people who insist on staying, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're not trying to force anyone from their home. We're not trying to be forceful, but we're trying to be very factual and definitive about the consequences of their decision, and we hope that they will come down,\" Pelle said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Special education teacher Brian Shultz, 38, was torn about leaving his Jamestown home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was thinking about staying. I could have lasted at least a year. I have a lot of training in wilderness survival,\" he said, adding that he probably had enough beer to last the whole time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As he sat outside a makeshift shelter at a high school, Shultz floated the idea of walking back into the funky mountain town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we hike back, I would stay there and just live. I'd rather be at our own house than staying at some other people's houses,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His wife, Meagan Harrington, gave him a wry smile. About 10 of their neighbors declined to evacuate, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They said they wouldn't force you, but it was strongly encouraged,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shultz teared up behind his sunglasses as he compared his situation to that of his neighbors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At least all of our stuff's there and will be there when we get back. The people right by the river, their houses were washed away. Other people thought their houses were going to be OK, and then they started to go. It's just really devastating.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the foothills, rescuers made progress against the floodwaters. But they were still unable to go up many narrow canyon roads that were either underwater or washed out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration and ordered federal aid for Colorado. The White House said in a statement Saturday night that the action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Boulder County. The government said that other counties could be added later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city of Longmont ordered a curfew from 10 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday in flood zones and evacuation areas, urging residents to remain indoors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, the surge of water reached the plains east of the mountains, cutting off more communities and diverting some rescue operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four people have been confirmed dead since the harrowing floods began Wednesday. And hundreds of others have not been heard from in the flood zone, which has grown to cover portions of an area nearly the size of Connecticut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of those who are unaccounted for may be stranded or injured. Others might have gotten out but not yet contacted friends and relatives, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police expected to find more bodies as the full scope of damage emerges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A woman was missing and presumed dead after witnesses saw floodwaters from the Big Thompson River destroy her home in the Cedar Cove area, Larimer County sheriff's spokesman John Schulz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I expect that we're going to continue to receive reports of confirmed missing and confirmed fatalities throughout the next several days,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two fatalities were identified by the Boulder County coroner Saturday as Wesley Quinlan and Wiyanna Nelson, both 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities believe the couple died when they were swept away after driving into floodwaters and then leaving their vehicle. Their cause of death is under investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The military put more troops on the ground and helicopters in the air to aid in the search-and-rescue effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Saturday night, 1,750 people and 300 pets had been evacuated from Boulder and Larimer County, National Guard Lt. James Goff said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The airlifts will continue Sunday with helicopter crews expanding their searches east to include Longmont, Fort Collins and Weld County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not clear how many people were still stranded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A helicopter taking Gov. John Hickenlooper on a tour of the flooded areas even got in the act, stopping twice to pick up six stranded people and their two pets. Terry Kishiyama's son flagged down a helicopter with his shirt after a three-day wait for rescue from a neighbor's house on higher ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You could hear the choppers for miles and miles, but I didn't know if they were evacuating people. You see a chopper going down behind a ridge, and you have no clue,\" Kishiyama said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to his son's efforts, Kishiyama said his wife shouted at the chopper, \"We have babies!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 85 fifth-graders from Louisville were greeted by their parents and friends Saturday after they were rescued from an outdoor education center near Jamestown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Above Larimer County, rescue crews airlifted 475 people to safety and planned to resume helicopter searches on Sunday, weather permitting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rain was expected to start up again in the mountains and foothills, with between a half-inch and 2 inches forecast to fall overnight, according to the National Weather Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crews also used inflatable boats to pick up families and pets from farmhouses on Saturday. Some evacuees on horseback had to be escorted to safe ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near Greeley, 35 miles east of the foothills, broad swaths of farmland had become lakes, and the raging South Platte and Poudre rivers surrounded more homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one Boulder neighborhood, residents turned back city crews and machinery that arrived to remove the makeshift berms and sand-filled trash bags protecting their homes. University of Colorado students helped homeowners improvise a way to divert the rising water from Gregory Creek. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The residents know better than anybody else how the water flows through the neighborhood,\" said Colleen Scanlan Lyons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In communities where floodwaters began receding, homeowners had a chance to assess damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Laporte, Wendy Clark surveyed soggy carpets and furniture that got damaged by the Poudre River.

{"context": "Walmart, saying it was inspired by first lady Michelle Obama's campaign to fight childhood obesity, is stepping up to the plate, announcing on Thursday a five-year plan to lower salts, fats and sugars in thousands of its products, and dropping prices for healthy items. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They're not really likely allies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After all, the White House and corporate America have had a fairly contentious relationship during the first two years of the Obama administration. Not to mention that Walmart, the world's largest retailer with billions in sales, doesn't need to adjust the product it puts on its shelves. And that's why the first lady's \"Let's Move\" campaign's collaboration with Walmart to offer healthier food is so surprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the initiative, Walmart will make healthier food choices more affordable, develop seals for the front of packaging to make healthier food more identifiable, address food desert issues and increase support for nutrition programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart sells more groceries than any other company in the U.S. and changes made by its suppliers could have a big impact on American's access to healthy food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking in front of stacks of produce and a giant \"Let's Move\" and \"Walmart\" banners, Mrs. Obama told a crowded auditorium at a community center in southeastern Washington, D.C., that Walmart's new, healthy charter is a huge victory for every American. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a victory for parents. It's a victory for families, but most of all, it's a victory for our children,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Obama's husband, the president, back in 2007 when he was serving in the U.S. Senate, criticized Walmart for not paying its workers more. All was forgiven on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart executives proudly joined the first lady at the event and described how her campaign motivated them to make a difference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you really have to look at is what's happening in our country and it really comes down to one basic truth: and the fact is that healthier eating -- and I think it's a goal we all share -- is really, really hard to do given the lifestyles that we live today,\" said Bill Simon, the CEO of Walmart. He called heart disease and diabetes complex problems for society, and he said Walmart realizes it has a role to play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a ringing endorsement of the first lady's campaign, Leslie Dach, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs at Walmart described Michelle Obama as the catalyst that lead to Walmart's commitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart Action Gets Mixed Reviews NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Through her 'Let's Move' campaign she's reached out and engaged every sector of society that can make a difference on this issue, and that's exactly the kind of leadership this nation needs,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walmart may have joined the first lady's campaign ultimately to help its bottom line. The company has been trying to open stores in big cities and says if they're allowed, they would bring healthier food to places with limited access to groceries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Obama, who is extremely enthusiastic about the announcement, said she believes Walmart's new charter represents something much bigger in her fight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we decided to take on the issue of childhood obesity, I have to tell you, in the back of my mind, I wondered if we could really make a difference,\" the first lady said. \"But today, when I see a company like Walmart launch an initiative like this I feel more hopeful than ever before…\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Efforts like this show us that 'yes' we can improve how we make and sell food in this country. We can do that.\" She said all across the country people are stepping up to improve nutrition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Obama has tied to attack the nation's childhood obesity epidemic head-on. She said as a mother, she understands the challenge parents face in providing healthy food for their children, and she hopes every sector of society gets involved in helping to make the next generation of children healthier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She picked up a major victory in December when President Obama signed into law The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The law provides more resources for school lunches and raises health standards on those lunches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Jacobson, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, cautioned that Walmart's imitative, while a good first step doesn't fully attack the problem. \"I don't think it's a revelation. I think it's a nice nudge in the right direction,\" Jacobson told ABC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wallmart wants its products as well as the products of suppliers reformulated so sodium levels are reduced by 25 percent and sugars by 10 percent. Jacobson thinks Walmart's insistence that suppliers reduce sodium could make a difference, but he says, the retailer took a baby step on sugar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm disappointed they didn't do anything with regard to soft drinks. They are the number one source of sugar and probably the biggest contributor in our diet to weight gain.\" Even though he'd like Walmart and the government to do more, Jacobson noted that the new charter could be a turning point. \"You have this huge company using its leverage to move the food industry in the right direction. ... There's been very good progress.\" ||||| Wal-Mart is hardly the first company to take such steps; ConAgra Foods , for example, has promised to reduce sodium content in its foods by 20 percent by 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But because Wal-Mart sells more groceries than any other company in the country, and because it is such a large purchaser of foods produced by national suppliers, nutrition experts say the changes could have a big impact on the affordability of healthy food and the health of American families and children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some say the company has almost as much power as federal regulators to shape the marketplace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A number of companies have said they are going to make voluntary reductions in sodium over the next several years, and numerous companies have said they are going to try to get trans fat out of their food,” said Michael Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest . “But Wal-Mart is in a position almost like the Food and Drug Administration . I think it really pushes the food industry in the right direction.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Wal-Mart is pushing only so far. The company’s proposed sugar reductions are “much less aggressive” than they could be, Mr. Jacobson said, noting that Wal-Mart is not proposing to tackle the problem of added sugars in soft drinks, which experts regard as a major contributor to childhood obesity. And he said it would be “nice if Wal-Mart’s timeline were speedier” than five years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wal-Mart has been planning the initiative for more than a year; the effort was in its early stages when Ms. Obama joined it. The first lady’s appearance with Mr. Dach and other Wal-Mart executives when they make the announcement at a community center in Washington’s Anacostia neighborhood on Thursday morning is out of the ordinary and a prominent effort by the administration to spur further moves toward healthier food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re not just aligning ourselves with one company; we’re aligning ourselves with people who are stepping up as leaders to take this country to a healthier place,” said Sam Kass, the White House chef who doubles as Mrs. Obama’s top adviser on matters of nutrition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s no qualms about that,” Mr. Kass said. “The only question that we have is do we think this is a significant step in that direction, and do we think there is a method in place to track progress, and do we think this will have the impact we are pushing for.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last year, Mr. Kass and other aides to the first lady have spent countless hours in meetings with company officials; both Mr. Kass and Mr. Dach said Mrs. Obama pushed the company to hold itself accountable by issuing public progress reports. The Partnership for a Healthier America, a nonprofit organization that works with the first lady on her Let’s Move initiative to reduce childhood obesity, will monitor the company’s progress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The changes will not happen overnight. Wal-Mart is pledging to reduce sodium by 25 percent, eliminate industrially added trans fats and reduce added sugars by 10 percent by 2015. Its other plans are less specific. In addition to proposing to lower prices on healthy foods, Wal-Mart is planning to develop criteria, and ultimately a seal, that will go on truly healthier foods, as measured by their sodium, fat and sugar content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company says it will also address the problem of “food deserts” — a dearth of grocery stores selling fresh produce in rural and underserved urban areas like Anacostia — by building more stores. And it will increase charitable contributions for nutrition programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A range of studies has shown that low-income people, especially those who receive food stamps, face special dietary challenges because eating healthy costs more and healthier food is harder to get in their neighborhoods. James D. Weill, president of Food Research and Action Center, an organization that has discussed the problem with Wal-Mart, said the company recognized “how much hunger and food insecurity there is in the country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Dach said the lower prices and food reformulations were motivated by the demands of Wal-Mart’s own customers. He said the company believed that, if it was successful, the price reductions would save Americans who shop at Wal-Mart approximately $1 billion a year on fresh fruits and vegetables alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our customers have always told us, ’We don’t understand why whole wheat macaroni and cheese costs more than regular macaroni and cheese,’ ” Mr. Dach said, adding, “We’ve always said that we don’t think the Wal-Mart shopper should have to choose between a product that is healthier for them and what they can afford.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Jacobson, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that reducing sodium was the trickiest of the food reformulation challenges. Sodium is in every food category, and it is more difficult to replace than the partly hydrogenated oil that composes trans fats, or than sugars, because there are easy substitutes for oils and sugars. But sodium, which contributes to hypertension and raises the risk of heart disease, must simply be reduced, which can greatly alter taste. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Dach said the company had yet to conquer its reformulation challenges, and described the goals as both aspirational and realistic. “We think it’s a realistic target, but it’s aspirational in the sense that we can’t tell you today how it’s all going to get done,” he said. ||||| Four years ago, leading Democrats were virtually at war with Wal-Mart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two prominent groups funded in part by labor unions were aggressively attacking the company for not paying its workers enough, as were several Democratic presidential candidates. Then-candidate Barack Obama pointedly declared he would not shop at Wal-Mart, and his wife resigned from the board of a Wal-Mart vendor called Tree Foods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now Democrats - or at least the Obamas - have shifted away from primarily casting Wal-Mart as the symbol of corporate greed, and are instead finding common cause with the low-price retail giant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was clear Thursday as first lady Michelle Obama appeared with Wal-Mart executives to announce that the chain will offer more healthful foods and push its suppliers to do the same. In announcing the initiative, Obama praised the Arkansas-based retailer, saying, \"When I see a company like Wal-Mart launch an initiative like this, I feel more hopeful than ever before.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The joint announcement is the latest step in the first lady's efforts to curb childhood obesity. Last year, she launched \"Let's Move,\" her signature initiative. Aides said that even before she rolled out the program, her staff was in talks with Wal-Mart, which had reached out to the White House, about joining her healthful foods push. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In endorsing the Wal-Mart initiative, the administration is allying itself with a company that has long been accused by liberals of opposing allowing its workers to unionize, paying low wages and not offering its workers enough benefits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR East Wing aides said that the first lady's involvement doesn't amount to an endorsement of a single company but instead reflects her support for Wal-Mart's commitment to expand the availability of food options and lower food costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The first lady is not getting behind a specific company, we are supporting all leadership on this issue,\" aid Sam Kass, assistant White House chef and coordinator of food initiatives. \"The first lady's guidance from Day One was whoever is serious about this issue has a seat at our table. After a year of conversation, we are convinced that they are serious and that today's announcement will have a substantial impact. This is real change for real people. We are obviously conscious about where we walk and who we walk with, but it was clear that this is potentially transformative, and the first lady is focused on solving these serious issues facing our nation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer Stapleton, the assistant director of Making Change at Walmart, a campaign run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said that President Obama's overall position on Wal-Mart remains unchanged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is clear that Mrs. Obama and the president have a real commitment to increasing health for our nation's children. But beyond that, I wouldn't read much into this as an endorsement of Walmart's business practices or expansion plans,\" she said in a statement. \"President Obama has been very clear about workers' rights to organize in this country and has named Walmart as one of the companies that has suppressed those rights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a subsequent statement, she said, \"If the Obama administration is serious about creating good jobs in this country - jobs that can expand the middle class, instead of state Medicaid rolls - then it needs to use its bully pulpit to challenge Walmart and other corporations to be more responsible employers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wal-Mart itself has shifted its approach. The company's political activity was once mostly limited to opposing greater regulation of business, but they have shifted to the left in recent years, boosting green products, and even backing parts of President Obama's health-care overhaul last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is unusual for a first lady to align herself so strongly with a private, for-profit company. But Michelle Obama has worked with the Grocery Manufacturers Association in calling for better packaging, choices and labeling for foods marketed to kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, her alliance with Wal-Mart - the nation's largest grocery store, a corporation that can decide how products are packaged and sold - allows Obama to exert great influence in an area of concern to her. The company is also increasingly moving into urban areas, where commercial blight has led to the problem of \"food deserts,\" where few grocery and food options are available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked on Thursday if the president would shop at Wal-Mart now, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that \"we're all in a different time\" and that the company has \"taken some dramatic steps in how they're dealing with food.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR baconp@washpost.com hendersonn@washpost.com"}

(Miguel Roberts/Brownsville Herald/AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration on Thursday announced it has chosen four companies to build concrete prototypes of the president’s much-touted border wall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Construction of the prototypes, to take place in San Diego, is the first step in fulfilling President Trump’s campaign promise of building a “big, beautiful” wall stretching along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Today we mark a significant milestone,” said Ronald Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. “This is the first tangible result of the action planning that has gone on. This is the use of the resources we had available for this year.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress has set aside $20 million in the current budget to build the prototypes but has not appropriated any other money for the wall. Each of the four contracts is worth between $400,000 and $500,000, Vitiello said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The companies chosen for the concrete prototypes were Caddell Construction of Montgomery, Ala.; Fisher Sand & Gravel/DBA Fisher Industries of Tempe, Ariz..; Texas Sterling Construction in Houston; and W.G.

Then the death threats began.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vitiello said the agency expects to award up to four more contracts for non-concrete prototypes next week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Construction on the concrete prototypes is expected to begin in two weeks, and should be completed this fall within 30 days after breaking ground. The prototypes will be 30 feet long and up to 30 feet high and will be located near one another, he said. They will act as a secondary barrier in a border enforcement zone that already has a fence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Homeland Security officials will spend 30 to 60 days using small hand tools to test the prototypes' resistance to tampering and penetration, Vitiello said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials will consider aesthetics as well as anti-climb features and how to complement the physical barrier with technology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are not just asking for a physical structure,” Vitiello said. “We’re asking for all the tools that help secure the border.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ronald Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, displays a rendering of a border enforcement region. (Tracy Jan) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration was originally expected to announce its decision in June, but the contracting process was delayed after protests from two companies that had not made the list of finalists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Government Accountability Office dismissed the protests last Friday, but unsuccessful bidders now have another opportunity to file new protests, which could further delay construction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his visit last week to Phoenix, Trump threatened to shut down the government if Congress does not agree to fund his wall in September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall,” Trump said during his Arizona rally. “The American people voted for immigration control. That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Trump’s wall: The inside story of how the president crafts immigration policy] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seven hundred miles of fencing has already been built in the most critical areas, following the 2006 Secure Fence Act under President George W. Bush. And there’s been a significant decrease in the number of illegal border crossers since Trump took office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government in March asked for design submissions for two types of wall: a reinforced concrete barrier wall and one made of an alternative material with see-through capability. The government specified that the wall must be insurmountable and “aesthetically pleasing in color,” at least from the U.S. side. It must also withstand digging for at least six feet below the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 200 companies responded with proposals. The contenders were winnowed down to a secret list of about 20 finalists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump earlier this summer had floated the possibility of a solar-paneled wall between 40 and 50 feet high as a way to help pay for construction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with less than 2 percent of the U.S. population living within 40 miles of the Mexico border, most of the electricity generated by the wall would be useless without the construction of costly transmission lines to channel the electricity to other parts of the country.

They could function as permanent barriers in San Diego or be removed or relocated elsewhere, Vitiello said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The companies selected to build the prototypes are not necessarily the ones that will be picked to build the wall, an agency official said. Another bidding process would ensue if funding was approved for the wall itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is not a competition to build the rest of the wall,” the official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The companies were notified just hours before the official announcement. Executives at Caddell and Texas Sterling declined to comment on the possibility that they are designing a wall that may never be built. Representatives at W.G. Yates & Sons did not immediately respond to Post inquiries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas Fisher, president of Fisher Sand & Gravel, said in a statement that the company is \"excited and grateful\" to participate in the wall project. The company is headquartered in Dickinson, ND but has operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s 2018 budget calls for $2.6 billion for “high-priority tactical infrastructure and border security technology.” Of that amount, $1.6 billion is for “bricks and mortar construction” and $1 billion is for infrastructure and technology, such as roads needed to access construction sites and surveillance equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House in July approved $1.6 billion in border wall funding for 2018, but Senate Democrats will likely block it in September. Even if Trump does get the money for his wall next year, he will face high hurdles -- with construction unlikely to begin until 2019 at the earliest because of the lengthy federal procurement process, said James Norton, former deputy assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Bush when the Secure Fence Act was passed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even beyond 2018, the administration will be in real trouble because it hasn't sold a longer term strategy for the physical wall to both Republicans and Democrats,\" said Norton, now a homeland security consultant. \"That's going to be a bigger challenge in getting anything built at this point.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the campaign, Trump has scaled back his wall ambitions, acknowledging that a continuous barrier would not be possible — nor necessary — given natural barriers such as lakes, rivers and mountains. A seamless wall is also unrealistic because of international treaty and flood-zone requirements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration had hoped to add more than 100 miles of wall over the next two years, according to a Department of Homeland Security planning document. Among the “high priority” locations would be the border sectors of the Rio Grande Valley in the southern tip of Texas as well as El Paso, Tucson and San Diego. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of the more than 400,000 undocumented immigrants apprehended along the southern border in 2016, nearly half were stopped in the Rio Grande Valley, according to data compiled by the U.S. Border Patrol. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [These border towns could be first to get Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ wall] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Customs and Border Protection said in June that it would be installing 35 new gates in the Rio Grande Valley to cover existing gaps and begin replacing fencing in San Diego and vehicle barriers in El Paso. Trump has pointed to these repairs as a sign that his wall promise was coming to life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Customs and Border Protection had initially planned to award contracts by June 12, with construction beginning by July 21, according to a June Homeland Security inspector general’s report. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Parts of the US border with Mexico are already sealed off NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four companies have been chosen to build prototypes for Donald Trump's planned border wall, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four concrete prototypes will be 30ft (9m) long and up to 30ft tall, and will be built in the coming months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials will then spend up to two months testing the walls for tampering and penetration resistance using small hand tools, CBP said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four contracts are worth up to $500,000 (£387,000) each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A continuous wall across the entire southern US border was a key promise in President Trump's election campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prototypes \"will help us refine the design standards\" of the eventual wall, acting CBP deputy commissioner Ronald Vitiello said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Testing will look at things like the aesthetics of it, how penetrable they are, how resistant they are to tampering, and scaling or anti-climb features.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said the officials would stick to small hand tools rather than testing \"ballistic kind of things\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The walls will also need to feature cable conduits and other design features for sensors and cameras.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four companies will build the prototypes in the San Diego area, said officials at Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the department. The companies selected will each have 30 days to complete the projects after the agency gives them the order to proceed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pinball prohibition in Kokomo stretches back decades, according to the Kokomo Tribune.

At the time of the ban, it is estimated that there were 103 pinball machines in the city.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Punishment for owning or operating a pinball machine was a fine of up to $300 and six months in jail, the Kokomo Tribune reports. The ordinance also gave police the power to impound any operating pinball machine they encountered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over 60 years later, the ban has still not been lifted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the city council is hoping to change that and vote to repeal the ban during a meeting on December 12.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Trump said Kim Jong-un would stay in power if he made a deal, and hinted he could be deposed if he refused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Libya's Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003. He was later killed by Western-backed rebels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most analysts say North Korea was angered by the prospect of a Libya scenario precisely because of what happened to Gaddafi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comparison was made by Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It led the North to threaten to pull out of the summit with Mr Trump in Singapore on 12 June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What did President Trump say? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Mr Bolton looked on, the US president said: \"The Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to \"the Libya model\" of denuclearisation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US president issued the threat at the White House when he was asked about the recent suggestion by his national security adviser, John Bolton, that the “Libyan model” be a template for dealing with North Korea at a summit between Trump and Kim planned for 12 June in Singapore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The model Bolton was referring to was Gaddafi’s agreement in December 2003 to surrender his embryonic nuclear weapons programme, which included allowing his uranium centrifuges to be shipped out to the US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Trump appeared to be unaware of that agreement, and interpreted the “Libyan model” to mean the 2011 Nato intervention in Libya in support of an insurrection, which ultimately led to Gaddafi’s murder at the hands of rebels in Tripoli.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re willing to do a lot, and he’s willing … to do a lot also, and I think we’ll actually have a good relationship, assuming we have the meeting and assuming something comes of it. And he’ll get protections that will be very strong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked whether his comments meant that he disagreed with his national security adviser, the third of his administration, the president said: “I think when John Bolton made that statement, he was talking about if we are going to be having a problem, because we cannot let that country have nukes. We just can’t do it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joel Wit, a former US negotiator who is now a senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said: “This is probably the wrong time to be making threats, three weeks before the summit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inflammatory comments come at a time when the June meeting is in doubt.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump maintained the scheduled June 12 meeting in Singapore is on track, despite the North's threat Wednesday to cancel over concerns about the U.S. push to see the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North has argued it needs its nuclear weapons to preserve its security, and has expressed concerns about giving up its nuclear program. The North cites the example of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who died at the hands of rebel forces amid a popular uprising in October 2011; he had given up his nuclear program in the 2000s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National Security Adviser John Bolton explicitly cited \"the Libya model of 2003-2004\" as a basis for the North Korea talks last month, which drew personal rebuke from the North Korean government Wednesday.

In Libya we decimated that country.\" Trump added. \"There was no deal to keep Gadhafi.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said he is \"willing to do a lot\" to provide security guarantees to Kim. \"The best thing he could do is make a deal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also suggested China was influencing North Korea's thinking regarding the summit, pointing to Kim's visit to China immediately before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Pyongyang last week to finalize the summit date and location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said Thursday that nothing has changed with respect to North Korea after the warning from Pyongyang. He said North Korean officials are discussing logistical details about the meeting with the U.S. \"as if nothing happened.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to threatening to pull out of the meeting with Trump, the North abruptly canceled a planned meeting with South Korean officials over joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said Thursday that the schedule of military exercises hasn't changed. She added the annual exercises are long-planned, defensive in nature and meant to ensure the readiness of U.S. and South Korean forces.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over his long career he was awarded numerous prizes and received many honours for his work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He recently suffered from ill health.

And no let up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Profound sorrow' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The death has taken place of Seamus Heaney,\" said a short statement issued by his family on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The poet and Nobel laureate died in hospital in Dublin this morning after a short illness. The family has requested privacy at this time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heaney's publisher, Faber, said: \"We cannot adequately express our profound sorrow at the loss of one of the world's greatest writers. His impact on literary culture is immeasurable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As his publisher we could not have been prouder to publish his work over nearly 50 years.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was educated at St Columb's College, Derry, a Catholic boarding school, and later at Queen's University Belfast, before training as a teacher. He settled in Dublin, with periods of teaching in the US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heaney was an honorary fellow at Trinity College Dublin and, last year, was bestowed with the Seamus Heaney Professorship in Irish Writing at the university, which he described as a great honour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Poet Simon Armitage pays tribute I'll remember him both as a poet and a person - an incredibly generous and open man. He was a great ambassador for poetry and I think that's recognised almost worldwide. People only had good things to say about his courtesy and his integrity. He was the poet I encountered at school and he made me think it was possible for anybody who showed an interest in poetry to write it. What made him so successful and so affirmed as a poet was the way he managed to straddle the intellectual rigors of poetry and the academic elements that come with that, with a lightness of touch that meant even people who weren't that interested in the art form would respond to his work. They're so deft and subtle and I suppose that was his ear for language. I remember once being in a pub with him in Shropshire - he was a superstar in the world of literature but in that pub he was like a guy from the village. He just sat there in the corner chatting way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His first book, Death of a Naturalist, published in 1966, reflected his rural upbringing, but as Ireland's troubles increased his work took a more political turn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, Heaney donated a collection of his literary papers to the National Library of Ireland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It included manuscripts of his poetry, a comprehensive and vast collection of loose-leaf, typescript and manuscript worksheets and bound notebooks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The collection spanned Heaney's literary career, from the publication of Death of a Naturalist (1966), to volumes such as Wintering Out (1972) and North (1975), right through to Station Island (1984), Seeing Things (1991) and his most recent publications, District and Circle (2006) and Human Chain (2010). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latter won the prestigious £10,000 Forward Prize in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heaney described the collection, his 12th, as his most personally revealing collection of poems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had been nominated for the Forward Prize three times before, but this was his first win. Judge and author Ruth Padel described Heaney's volume as \"painful, honest, and delicately weighted\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the course of his career, Heaney also won the TS Eliot Prize, and was made Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also the professor of poetry at Oxford University between 1989 and 1994. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with the Today programme's James Naughtie in early 2013, Heaney remembered how he felt when he first discovered poetry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was the voltage of the language, it was entrancing,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think the first little jolt I got was reading Gerard Manley Hopkins - I liked other poems... but Hopkins was kind of electric for me - he changed the rules with speech and the whole intensity of the language was there and so on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Irish President Michael D Higgins said Heaney's contribution \"to the republics of letters, conscience, and humanity was immense\".

I'd originally referred to him as being widely regarded as the foremost poet of his generation, but he asked me to replace that comment with the Miller line.

{"context": "Just when you thought there was no way for NBC to swim another lap in the pink marble pool of Donald Trump, the network has scheduled a ripped-from-the-Donald-Trump-headlines episode of Law & Order: SVU for October 26 – one week after the GOP candidate’s final debate with Dem hopeful Hillary Clinton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s also the night before the start of the November sweep, which is a bit surprising given that high-profile L&O franchise’s topical episodes are tailor-made sweep stunts. On the other hand, waiting until the following week puts it uncomfortably close to Election Day, November 8, and given all the Trump/Election-related minefields NBC is tip-toeing through right now, that’s a date best avoided on this episode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This now-ironically titled “Unstoppable” episode of SVU is not to be confused with Seth Meyers’ offer to Trump, which we think is still good, to star him as President in a new totally-not-Dick-Wolf-produced-but-he-can’t-stop-you-from-making-comparisons drama series Chicago President, if Trump will drop out of the race. Which, as Meyers pointed out, never was actually endorsed by NBC but, after last week’s tape drop and Sunday’s debate, we’re pretty confident would be endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP bigwigs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyway, getting back to SVU, in the episode, the totally-not-Trump-but-they-can’t-stop-you-from-making-comparisons character, played by Gary Cole, is a big galoot but loaded with the stuff. He’s contemplating a change of address to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. for eight years, only some women with sordid stories are trying to thwart him from moving on up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, chatter about the episode intensified when it was booked for this week. At some point that plan changed, which is just as well because, well, Billy Bush, Access Hollywood, etc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some press reports then moved it to the day after Election Day. Which made no sense, given the way Trump’s numbers have been trending since WaPo released that Access Hollywood tape in which the then-Apprentice star told Bush he’s so rich he gets to kiss and grope women with impunity. That would have been a high-risk date. Ryan’s decision not to campaign with Trump and focus on saving GOP control of both houses of Congress suggests he, like NBC schedulers, think there is a good chance Trump will have been sent to the dustbin of history that day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So NBC settled on October 26, which is one week after Trump’s final debate with Clinton, moderated by Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace. Should be a doozy. Deadline will live-blog it as per usual. ||||| Story highlights \"Law & Order: SVU\" is telling an election-themed tale in an October episode NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gary Cole will guest star as a politician who's campaign goes \"haywire\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) Here's a story that might sound familiar: A politician's election campaign goes off the rails after the candidate's troublesome treatment of women in the past comes to light. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Draw your own conclusions. But for the purposes of fiction, it's a story that will soon be told on NBC's long-running procedural \"Law & Order: SVU.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show, a drama known for borrowing from headlines for its stories, is taking on the election with an episode called \"Unstoppable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gary Cole (\"Veep\") will play the fictional politician in question -- one NBC won't outright say was inspired by any particular political figure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cole's character finds himself on the defense after \"several women go public with damaging accusations\" that cause his campaign to go \"haywire,\" according to a brief plot description. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read More ||||| NBC’s “Law & Order: SVU” has a long history of developing stories inspired by real-life headlines. This season, one of the show’s most provocative episodes is sure to be “Unstoppable,” which features a Donald Trump-esque character running for president who gets tangled up in a sordid case when several women come forward with damaging accusations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gary Cole stars as a character described by a source as a wealthy and boorish man who makes a run for the White House. Aspects of the story were said to be inspired by the civil lawsuit pending against Trump, the Republican nominee for president, by a woman who alleges she was raped by Trump when she was 13 in the mid-1990s. Trump’s attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations by the woman identified in court documents as Jane Doe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Unstoppable,” penned by “SVU” veteran Julie Martin and showrunner Rick Eid, has been highly scrutinized internally at Wolf Entertainment, home of “SVU,” and by NBC brass. Sources said the episode was envisioned by the writing team as airing as the second installment of the “SVU’s” 18th season, which opened Sept. 21. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The episode is said to have undergone story adjustments along the way, changes that raised eyebrows among some “SVU” writers and actors. Last month NBC formally scheduled “Unstoppable” to air Oct. 12 but then took it off that date. At one point the episode was believed to be bound to air on Nov. 9, the day after Election Day. On Tuesday, NBC confirmed it would air on Oct. 26. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There had been concern that keeping the episode from airing until after the election would have been a politically motivated decision — a question that became moot with the final scheduling call. A source close to the situation noted that “SVU” episodes that hew closely to real-life characters, particularly political figures, usually come in for extra scrutiny for tone and fairness, even in a fictionalized setting. “Unstoppable” also features guest stars Peter Gallagher, Currie Graham, Meredith Travers and Bianca Amato. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NBC found itself in the thick of a Trump controversy last week that has had huge ramifications for his presidential campaign. The release of an audio recording from a 2005 “Access Hollywood” segment that captured Trump making lewd comments about women and bragging about using his celebrity to force himself on women has sparked outrage and prompted dozens of GOP leaders and members of Congress to distance themselves from his campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, NBC has a long history of business with Trump, from his 11 years on as frontman of “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice” to the Miss Universe beauty pageant franchise that NBCUniversal co-owned with Trump until last year. In light of the “Access Hollywood” revelation, Trump’s actions on “Apprentice” and the pageants are being investigated by journalists for evidence of other incendiary behavior by the candidate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the hothouse environment of the 2016 presidential race, it’s no surprise that the “SVU” episode would get a few extra looks before making it to air.

After Corgill was moved from teaching second grade to fifth, she was told she wasn't qualified to teach fifth-graders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, Corgill was named one of four finalists for the National Teacher of the Year award. She is a 21-year teaching veteran whose story — and candid resignation letter — has made waves in the education community and beyond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After running into a \"wall of bureaucracy,\" Corgill said in a statement to AL.com, \"When the news came that I was not considered highly qualified, my frustration boiled over.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update at 2:58 p.m. ET: 'It's Time To Bring Joy' Back NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Responding to a request for comment on the reaction to her resignation, Corgill sent a message saying: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's time to bring joy, professionalism, and pride back to the profession. It's time we speak up so that all schools can attract and retain the most highly qualified teachers. If I can be that voice for thousands of colleagues and children, I will certainly and always be that voice and that teacher.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our original post continues: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she was named Alabama's elementary school Teacher of the Year in the spring of 2014, Corgill taught fourth graders at Cherokee Bend Elementary, in Mountain Brook. In August, she was hired to teach second grade at Birmingham's Oliver Elementary, which Alabama Public Radio describes as \"a low-income, federally funded school.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after the school year started, Corgill was shifted to fifth grade — and that's when things started to unravel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saying that she had been \"excited and confident\" about helping her students, Corgill wrote in her resignation letter (which was acquired by AL.com) that she had \"worked long hours to give these fifth graders my best teaching, my support, and my love.\" She said that after just five weeks, the results had made her proud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then Corgill cited the views of both Birmingham and Alabama administrators — that she's not qualified to teach above third grade, and that to do so, she would need to acquire an additional state certification. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill wrote that she holds certificates in early childhood education, both of them with \"highly qualified\" status. She added that despite her National Board Certification as a middle childhood educator — which certifies her to teach children up to the age of 12 — the administrators had determined that she must apply for a new Alabama certificate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"After 21 years of teaching in grades 1-6 I have no answers as to why this is a problem now,\" Corgill wrote, \"so instead of paying more fees, taking more tests, and proving once again that I am qualified to teach, I am resigning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill's last day was Friday. Responding to her resignation, Alabama State Superintendent Thomas Bice told AL.com that the Birmingham school's designation as a federal Title I facility puts teachers under different requirements than those of Corgill's previous school. That means she can't teach above third grade at the Birmingham school, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the certification questions, Corgill also cited an accounting error, saying that she wasn't paid for her first month of work until last Friday. In her letter to the Birmingham Board of Education, she said that she's still waiting for an explanatory letter to help her deal with her creditors and credit agencies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coping with that situation while teaching, she said, was \"stressful at best.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill concludes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Please know that I wanted to give my all and share my expertise with Birmingham City Schools. In order to attract and retain the best teachers, we must feel trusted, valued, and treated as professionals. It is my hope that my experience can inform new decisions, policies, and procedures to make Birmingham City Schools a place everyone wants to work and learn.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Alabama native, Corgill has taught at several schools in the state, along with the Manhattan New School in New York City. She also wrote a book about education and writing, called Of Primary Importance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss writes, \"Corgill isn't the first high-achieving teacher to resign this year. Stacie Starr, a ninth-grade intervention specialist in Elyria City Schools in Ohio, who was selected as 'Top Teacher' last year in a national search by the popular television show Live with Kelly and Michael, said earlier this year she was quitting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starr, a 15-year veteran, said that months of standardized state testing had taken over her classroom and was hurting her students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Alabama, Corgill says that despite her frustration, she isn't done with teaching. She told AL.com Friday that she \"will continue to give my life to the profession.\" ||||| Ann Marie Corgill, the 2014-2015 Alabama Teacher of the Year and 2015 National Teacher of the Year finalist who submitted a letter of resignation to Birmingham City Schools this week after confusion over her certification, said a \"wall of bureaucracy\" led to the resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill, a fifth-grade teacher at Oliver Elementary School, was informed by the district and the Alabama Department of Education last week that she did not meet federal requirements to continue teaching fifth grade at the school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The wall of bureaucracy I encountered trying to straighten all of this out with my employer led to my writing the letter,\" Corgill told AL.com in a written statement. \"This experience has shown me the importance of teachers' voices in public education.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oliver Elementary is a Title I school, meaning it receives federal funding and special assistance because it has high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families. Title I schools exist to help ensure that those students meet state academic standards, according to the U.S. Department of Education website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the school's special distinction, teachers there must meet the federal requirements to be considered a \"highly-qualified teacher\" – a designation Corgill does not meet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill, who was a fourth grade teacher at Cherokee Bend Elementary School in Mountain Brook before moving to Oliver, holds Class A and B state certifications to teach primary school through third grade. She also holds a National Board Certification to teach children ages 7-12, which would include most fifth graders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill was able to teach Cherokee Bend fourth graders because that school is not a Title I school, State Superintendent Thomas Bice said in a written statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unlike her tenure in the Mountain Brook City School System, (Corgill) teaches in a Title I School that receives Title I funds,\" Bice said. \"Since Ms. Corgill's current Alabama teaching certificate is for early childhood education inclusive of Grades P-3 and the fact that she currently is assigned to teach 5th grade, she does not meet this federal requirement.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Corgill, who has taught in first through sixth grade for 21 years and is one of four finalists for 2015 National Teacher of the Year, the experience has been frustrating. In her resignation letter, she wrote that she had no answers as to why her certification has recently become a problem, and that she chose to resign instead of taking tests to again prove she is qualified to teach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When the news came that I was not considered highly qualified, my frustration boiled over,\" Corgill said in her statement Friday. \"First and foremost, I am a National Board certified teacher who has and will continue to give my life to the profession. Every child I teach and learn from is a part of me. I love them and work to give them my best.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also in the resignation letter, Corgill wrote that she was moved from second grade to fifth grade after the semester began, and that she received her first paycheck of the year on Oct. 23. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remained unclear on Friday whether Corgill's lack of highly-qualified teacher status was discussed before she was hired at Oliver Elementary, why she was moved after the semester began and why she received the paycheck so late in the semester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Birmingham City Schools spokeswoman Chanda Temple said the district continues to work through the situation but could not comment further because it is a personnel matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corgill, too, told AL.com on Friday that she is working with the district to come to a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At this point, we are working together to try and solve this immediate set of problems,\" she said in her statement."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DISTRICT ATTORNEY County of New York June 30, 2011 People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn Indictment No. 2526/2011 Dear Mssrs. (William) Taylor and (Benjamin) Brafman: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In connection with the above-captioned case, the People disclose the following information to the defense pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law 240.20 as well as Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its doctrinal progeny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal dated December 30, 2004, the complainant provided the United States Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service with factual information about herself, her background and her experiences in her home country of Guinea. This information was in the form of a written statement attached to her application, and was submitted as a basis for her request for asylum. In her application, she certified under penalty of perjury that her written statement was true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In substance, the complainant's statement claimed that she and her husband had been persecuted and harassed by the dictatorial regime that was then in power in Guinea. Among other things, the complainant stated that the home she shared with her husband was destroyed by police and soldiers acting on behalf of the regime, and she and her husband were beaten by them. When her husband attempted to return to what was left of their home the next day, she stated that he was again beaten, arrested and imprisoned by police and soldiers. She stated that she also was beaten when she attempted to come to her husband's aid. In her statement, she attributed the beatings to the couple's opposition to the regime. She stated that during her husband's incarceration, he was tortured, deprived of medical treatment, and eventually died as a result of his maltreatment. Following his death, according to her, she began to denounce the regime and finally fled the country in fear of her life, entering the United States in January 2004 to seek refuge (she has told prosecutors that she used a fraudulent visa). She repeated these facts orally during the course of her asylum application process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews in connection with the investigation of this case, the complainant admitted that the above factual information, which she provided in connection with her asylum application, was false. She stated that she fabricated the statement with the assistance of a male who provided her with a cassette recording of the facts contained in the statement that she eventually submitted. She memorized these facts by listening to the recording repeatedly. In several interviews with prosecutors, she reiterated these falsehoods when questioned about her history and background, and stated that she did so in order to remain consistent with the statement that she had submitted as part of her application. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, in two separate interviews with assistant district attorneys assigned to the case, the complainant stated that she had been the victim of a gang rape in the past in her native country and provided details of the attack. During both of these interviews, the victim cried and appeared to be markedly distraught when recounting the incident. In subsequent interviews, she admitted that the gang rape had never occurred. Instead, she stated that she had lied about its occurrence and fabricated the details, and that this false incident was part of the narrative that she had been directed to memorize as part of her asylum application process. Presently, the complainant states that she would testify that she was raped in the past in her native country but in an incident different than the one that she described during initial interviews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the weeks following the incident charged in the indictment, the complainant told detectives and assistant district attorneys on numerous occasions that, after being sexually assaulted by the defendant on May 14, 2011 in Suite 2806, she fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant leave Suite 2806 and the 28th floor by entering an elevator. It was after this observation that she reported the incident to her supervisor, who arrived on the 28th floor a short time later. In the interim between the incident and her supervisor's arrival, she claimed to have remained in the same area of the main hallway on the 28th floor to which she had initially fled. The complainant testified to this version of events when questioned in the Grand Jury about her actions following the incident in Suite 2806, she proceeded to clean a nearby room and then returned to Suite 2806 and began to clean that suite before she reported the incident to her supervisor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, the complainant has stated that for the past two tax years, she declared a friend's child in addition to her own as a dependent on her tax returns for the purpose of increasing her tax refund beyond that to which she was entitled. She also admitted to misrepresenting her income in order to maintain her present housing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, during the course of this investigation, the complainant was untruthful with assistant district attorneys about a variety of additional topics concerning her history, background, present circumstances and personal relationships.

{"context": "Movie stars are supposedly nothing like you and me. They're svelte, glamorous, self-­possessed. They wear dresses we can't afford and live in houses we can only dream of. Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1997, just before Ashley Judd's career took off, she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein, head of the starmaking studio Miramax, at a Beverly Hills hotel. Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,\" Judd says in an interview with TIME. \"Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me. I told him. I told everyone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TIME NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years. It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. \"Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?\" Judd asks. \"There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened. (Weinstein said he \"never laid a glove\" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the \"problem that has no name,\" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #MeToo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM?' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old. ‘ We need to formalize the whisper network. It's an ingenious way that we've tried to keep ourselves safe. All those voices can be amplified. That's my advice to women. That and if something feels wrong, it is wrong—and it's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else's. ’ Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove' on Judd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City's regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They're part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR II NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco's Mission District, a group of women from different worlds met for the first time. Judd, every bit the movie star in towering heels, leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual, a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family. Beside her, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, eight months pregnant, spoke softly with Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento. A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From a distance, these women could not have looked more different. Their ages, their families, their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart. Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe: Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on that November morning, what separated them was less important than what brought them together: a shared experience. Over the course of six weeks, TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries, all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs. They often had eerily similar stories to share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In almost every case, they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself—years of lewd comments, forced kisses, opportunistic gropes—but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances. Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame. Had she somehow asked for it? Could she have deflected it? Was she making a big deal out of nothing? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react?\" says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family's livelihood should her story come out in her small community. \"I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.?\" It's a poisonous, useless thought, she adds, but how do you avoid it? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day. She can still feel the heat of her harasser's hands on her body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag #MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter. ‘ It's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I have not stopped crying. I look at my daughter and think, Please, let this be worth it. Please, let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this. ’ Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence, created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. ‘ Sexual harassment does bring shame. And I think it's really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For some, the fear was born of a threat of physical violence. Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home, but felt she was powerless to stop him. If she told anyone, the abuser warned her, he would come after her or her children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those who are often most vulnerable in society—immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people—described many types of dread. If they raised their voices, would they be fired? Would their communities turn against them? Would they be killed? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 47% of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, both in and out of the workplace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED, HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER.' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them, Blair spoke out about her encounter with him. ‘ I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial. He called the women liars. But their stories were so similar to mine, and they were such credible women. There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story, be free of this story. And in a magazine interview, he called the people who said this about him 'c-nts' and 'c-cksuckers.' That was just wrong. And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out. ’ Toback has denied all allegations of harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls \"feeling the pressure of someone's eyes\" on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. \"Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,\" she recalls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While guests come and go, some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers. Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza, a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite. \"Walking in, it's breathtaking,\" she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then, she says, a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like \"I can tell you had sex last night\" and groping her. One of those encounters was even caught on camera, but the management did not properly respond, her lawyers say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left: Veronica Owusu, Gabrielle Eubank, Crystal Washington, Dana Lewis, Paige Rodriguez, Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault' among employees there. ‘ 'I am a single mother. I have an 11-year-old daughter, and she's depending on me,' says Lewis, who still works at the hotel to make ends meet. 'My entire life revolves around her. I wasn't really left with the option of leaving. I'm not left with the option of giving up. I want to show her that it's O.K. to stand up for yourself. If you keep fighting, eventually you'll see the sun on the other side.' ’ Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel. But she cannot afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she's accused. \"It's a dream to be an employee there,\" Washington says. \"And then you find out what it really is, and it's a nightmare.\" (Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other women, like the actor Selma Blair, weathered excruciating threats. Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room. There, she says, Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down. She took her top off. She says he then propositioned her for sex, and when she refused, he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg. Afterward, she recalls him telling her that if she said anything, he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades. \"I had heard from others that he was slandering me, saying these sexual things about me, and it just made me even more afraid of him,\" Blair says in an interview with TIME. \"I genuinely thought for almost 20 years, He's going to kill me.\" ( Toback has denied the allegations, saying he never met his accusers or doesn't remember them.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear, one less visceral but no less real, as a reason for not speaking out: if you do, your complaint becomes your identity. \"'Susan Fowler, the famous victim of sexual harassment,'\" says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees. \"Nobody wants to be the buzzkill,\" adds Lindsey Reynolds, one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh. (The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect. Besh apologized for \"unacceptable behavior\" and \"moral failings,\" and resigned from the company. ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iwu, the lobbyist, says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event. She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault. The next week, she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government. When she told people about the campaign, she says they were wary. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" they warned her. \"Remember Anita Hill.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment, the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments. ‘ We can't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in. And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it's a member of our own party. ’ Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately. Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her. ‘ I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react? Why couldn't I force words out of my mouth? When I got home, I crumbled. I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.? ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller's lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she'd gotten him fired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,\" she told the lawyer. \"I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine.\" (Mueller said he would appeal.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. \"I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,\" she says, \"imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance.\" Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they'd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHEN I TESTIFIED, I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN'S ATTORNEY BULLY, BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM, INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY.' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013. She reported him to his radio station, KYGO, and he was terminated. He said her accusations were false and sued Swift. She countersued for $1 and won. ‘ In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite? ’ Mueller's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was the great unleashing that turned the #MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry. The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault. A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase, and Milano, almost on a whim, tweeted it out on Oct. 15. \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,\" she wrote, and then went to sleep. She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used #MeToo. Milano burst into tears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment, but the hashtag quickly spread. \"We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender,\" says Burke, who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages. By November, California farmworkers, Pascual among them, were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Women were no longer alone. \"There's something really empowering about standing up for what's right,\" says Fowler, who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower. \"It's a badge of honor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sandra Pezqueda 37 Former Dishwasher More Pezqueda filed a suit alleging that her supervisor at the Terranea Resort, a luxury retreat in South California, pursued her for months. When she rebuffed him, he changed her schedule and cut her hours. ‘ Someone who is in the limelight is able to speak out more easily than people who are poor. The reality of being a woman is the same—the difference is the risk each woman must take. ’ Attorneys for the staffing company that employed Pezqueda deny her allegations. Terranea Resort declined to comment except to say that the suit involves an outside agency. Blaise Godbe Lipman 28 Director More Lipman accused a former agent, Tyler Grasham, of sexually assaulting him when he was 18. Grasham has since been dismissed by his agency and is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. ‘ I experienced a little bit of victim blaming, victim shaming—people digging into my Instagram and pulling up sexy photos, as if that discredited me from speaking out against sexual violence. And gay men are often highly sexualized in the media, so coming out with a story of sexual assault, especially one that also involved alcohol and maybe drugs, there is an idea that 'Well, did you want it?.' ’ Grasham could not be reached for comment. Correction: The original version of this caption incorrectly said Tyler Grasham was Lipman’s agent. Grasham never represented Lipman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR III NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms: harassment becomes \"inappropriate behavior,\" assault becomes ­\"misconduct,\" rape becomes \"abuse.\" We're accustomed to hearing those softened words, which downplay the pain of the experience. That's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt. The language used by the man who would become America's 45th President, captured on a 2005 recording, was, by any standard, vulgar. He didn't just say that he'd made a pass; he \"moved on her like a bitch.\" He didn't just talk about fondling women; he bragged that he could \"grab 'em by the pussy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration. It's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size. \"All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors,\" says Aldon Morris, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. \"In this case, you had Harvey Weinstein, and before that you had Trump.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Megyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. \"I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,\" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. \"But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE.' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room. McGowan's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser. ‘ The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense, especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well. People forget a lot that there's a human behind this, someone who is very hurt. But that's O.K. It fuels my fire. They really f-cked with the wrong person. ’ Weinstein has denied all allegations of non­consensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning \"pussy hats\" and marching on the nation's capital in a show of unity and fury. What was startling was the size of the protest. It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment. She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar. A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office. No matter the outcome, the allegations added fuel to a growing fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By February, the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley, when Fowler spoke out about her \"weird year\" as an engineer at Uber. \"I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\" Fowler says. \"I felt like I had to take action.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barely two months later, Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $13 million to settle claims against him from five women. In October, the Times revealed a sixth settlement, bringing that total to more than $45 million. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and former guest on the network, was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor—but she was initially reluctant to go on the record. \"I was afraid for my kids, I was afraid of the retaliation,\" she says. \"I know what men can do when they're angry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually she allowed her name to be used. \"I felt it was my duty,\" Walsh says, \"as a mother of daughters, as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced, to be brave.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The downfall of O'Reilly, who has denied all allegations of harassment, would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment. In June, Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand, one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades. Although the case ended in a mistrial—it is scheduled to be retried in April—the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture, a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, Fox News fired him. ‘ In the early '90s, as a news anchor, I wore buttoned-up suits, skirts to my knees, sensible shoes. I dipped out of the industry. When I came back, I was put in a sausage dress. The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher. Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter: any woman, even a woman with advanced degrees, would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy. Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room. ’ O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues. Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh, Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company's culture of sexism. She later filed a complaint with the EEOC. Besh has since stepped down. ‘ After I sent that email, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking. I was nobody. I'm just a person from a small town in Texas. I have no money, no power, no social standing. And they have more power and money than I will ever have. I felt extremely vulnerable and scared. Then I heard from women I had never met—they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate—who had experienced the same toxic culture. ’ The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect. Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable' behavior and 'moral failings,' and resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Complaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia. The chief executive of SoFi, the $4 billion lending firm, resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment. Then, in early October, the dam finally broke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Oct. 5, the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser, as a serial sexual predator. The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks. Weinstein denied the allegations, but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed. Fellow chieftains refused to defend him. Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations. His company's board fired him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days, the head of Amazon Studios, an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims. By the end of the month, the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin, a former TIME employee; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier; and numerous politicians and journalists. The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME. I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers. ‘ I was afraid. When the man was harassing me, he threatened to harm my children and me—that's why I kept quiet. I felt desperate. I cried and cried. But, thank God, my friends in the fields support me. So I said, Enough. I lost the fear. It doesn't matter if they criticize me. I can support other people who are going through the same thing. ’ *Pascual's name was changed to protect her family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward. In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28–30, 82% of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations. Meanwhile, 85% say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movement—and fallout—quickly spread around the world. Michael Fallon, Britain's Defense Secretary, quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had \"lunged\" at her in 2003, when she was a 29-year-old reporter. In France, women took to the streets chanting not only \"Me too\" but also \"Balance ton porc ,\" which translates roughly to \"Expose your pig,\" a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller. In the week after #MeToo first surfaced, versions of it swept through 85 countries, from India, where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years, to the Middle East, Asia and parts in between. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who invested in her first company, harassed her. After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck, he resigned from his firm. ‘ I wanted it to stop. I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed, called, text-messaged. That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury—because I didn't want it to be a big deal. For so long, I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way. And now I see that that is so silly. I am a person with dignity. ’ Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable.' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working. ‘ One time when I was cleaning, a guest asked me if I knew how to massage. I said, 'No, I don't even do it to my husband.' The way he was looking at me wasn't friendly. I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there. It's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room, they are paying for sexual service. ’ The hotel declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Suddenly,\" says Terry Reintke, a German member of the European Parliament, who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25, \"friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By November, the spotlight was back on American politicians. A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate, abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore, including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers. Moore has called the allegations \"false\" and \"malicious.\" \"Specifically, I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman,\" he said in late November. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END.' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France, Muller started the Twitter hashtag #BalanceTonPorc (Expose Your Pig), which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment. ‘ France is a country of love, but there is love and love, you know? There are ways to approach a woman, and if it's done with respect, it's O.K. Without respect, it's not good. Now if men want your love, they have to ask themselves how to be, how to approach a woman. They are scared. We must restart all relationships from the beginning. We have to cleanse society to find a better way. I'm sure the road will be long and difficult, but it will be positive in the end. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The following week, radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006, before he was in office. Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken, who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior. On Dec. 5, Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff. He has said that the allegations \"are not accurate; they are not true.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Texas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014. Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral. Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees. ‘ When other women spoke out, they were retaliated against. So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid: 'I'm not going to sue, because they'll make me sign a non­disclosure agreement. I'm not going to do press right afterward, because they'll say I'm doing it for attention. I can't have any emotion in my blog. I have to be very, very detached.' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation, so it couldn't be 'he said, she said.' And that's what I did. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The accused were both Democrats and Republicans, but the consequences thus far have been limited—and often filtered through a partisan lens. In politics, at least, what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe. In the 1990s, feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his ­accusers—a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President. And despite the allegations against Moore, both ­President Trump and the Republican National Committee support him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll, which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party. The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign (71% and 74% respectively), when the accused offender was in the GOP, only 54% of Republicans would demand a resignation (compared to 82% of Democrats). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE? LET'S FLIP IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING.' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault. Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event. Venit was briefly suspended from the agency. ‘ People were saying, 'You should have beaten him up.' I'm like, Why is nobody questioning him? Nobody questions the predator. You know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, 'No more.' Why are you questioning the victim here? Let's flip it. Let's talk about what the predator is doing. ’ The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit, who declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As another election cycle approaches, Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression. Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope, a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms. There wasn't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there, Carmita Wood, filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her. The university denied her claim, arguing that she left the job for \"personal reasons.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd (right) and Jessica Cantlon (left), along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department, filed complaints with the university and the EEOC, alleging harassment and retaliation. ‘ 'If they couldn't stop us from talking, they were going to stop every­body from listening,' says Cantlon. 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us. But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint. I think working together was powerful. It was hard to silence all of us.' ’ The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wood, joined by activists from the university's human-affairs program, formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields, from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants, to talk about their own harassment experiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we're seeing today, encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone. But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow, legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent. In the 1970s, most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever, and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME.' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior. She had. In 2016, Kelly revealed that she'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. ‘ I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter. I never thought things could change for me. Never. I believed the system was stacked against women, and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I'm starting to see it so differently. What if we did complain? What if we didn't whine, but insisted that those around us did better? ’ Ailes denied Kelly's claims of harassment before he died in May. O'Reilly said he didn't know of any complaint by Kelly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It was a victory, but with caveats: even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal, it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck—in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define. What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition, interpretation has evolved slowly, shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue. But, she says, \"The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace. It was about the fallout in politics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More From left: Jane Merrick, journalist; Zelda Perkins, producer; Terry Reintke, Parliament member; Bex Bailey, charity worker. ‘ Britain's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged' at her when she was a young reporter: 'I think we're all part of this movement. On Twitter, there aren't any country borders, because it's such a powerful thing. There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country.” ’ Fallon said in a statement that he's 'behaved inappropriately in the past.' Kate Peters for TIME NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even now, the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky. Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line, like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap. But others feel more ambiguous. Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris, who specializes in workplace training, says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves. \"It's more like, 'I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice, I wonder when it's O.K. to give a hug, I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room,'\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment. ‘ The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City. I was trying to figure out my place in the art world, my place in the city, my place as an adult in the workplace. The harassment began so early, and it was so accepted in the industry. When I finally spoke out publicly, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. I was afraid that I didn't have the strength to make it stop. I don't feel that fear anymore. ’ Artforum's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt. Landesman could not be reached for comment. Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California's capital, which launched a state-senate investigation. ‘ Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago. And all I did was participate in the whisper network: 'Here's what you can wear,' 'Here's where you can go,' 'Here's who to avoid.' But you have to address it head on and as a group. It's hard to call 147 women liars. We can't all be crazy. We can't all be sluts. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This uncertainty can be corrosive. While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists, there is a risk that the net may be cast too far. What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee? Neither should be encouraged, but nor should they be equated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep up. Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment, and many have anti–sexual harassment training programs and claim to be \"zero-­tolerance workplaces.\" A 2016 EEOC report found that a company's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers—high-performing men like Kalanick, Weinstein and O'Reilly—to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-­suites and corporate boards overlooked harassment. It doesn't matter how good a company's policy is if its systems are ignored or don't work. \"So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office ,\" says Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the EEOC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some instances, sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire. In a 2001 study, Lisa Scherer, an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment, it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture. \"What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect,\" she says. \"They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Employers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits. The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15% increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017. And Advisen, which tracks insurance trends, says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30% since 2011, which indicates that more companies are reporting losses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corporate boards, wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press, have been among the quickest to make changes. Uber, for example, which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms, used to be a guiding light for small startups. Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber, says Fowler. \"There's a shift to, 'We're not disrupting anymore. We're trying to build something that's good for consumers and treats employees fairly.'\" It's a start. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local governments have also taken some concrete steps. In October, the Chicago city council passed an ordinance­ requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms. In Springfield, Ill., lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-­harassment complaints in the statehouse. In Arizona, pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS.' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her, this young Native American woman says she felt trapped. Her office had no HR department. She didn't feel her colleagues or family on her small, conservative reservation would believe her. So she quit her job. ‘ On the reservation, we keep to ourselves and don't really put too much out there. I thought of all the other people that had no voice. They're scared to do something like this because their parents say, 'You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to speak up.' ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the federal level, the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training. A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements—legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason, including sexual harassment. Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR V NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We're still at the bomb-throwing point of this revolution, a reactive stage at which nuance can go into hiding. But while anger can start a revolution, in its most raw and feral form it can't negotiate the more delicate dance steps needed for true social change. Private conversations, which can't be legislated or enforced, are essential. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Norms evolve, and it's long past time for any culture to view harassment as acceptable. But there's a great deal at stake in how we assess these new boundaries—for women and men together. We can and should police criminal acts and discourage inappropriate, destructive behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least we've started asking the right questions. Ones that seem alarmingly basic in hindsight: \"What if we did complain?\" proposes Megyn Kelly. \"What if we didn't whine, but we spoke our truth in our strongest voices and insisted that those around us did better? What if that worked to change reality right now?\" Kelly acknowledges that this still feels more like a promise than a certainty. But for the moment, the world is listening.

They're svelte, glamorous, self-­possessed. They wear dresses we can't afford and live in houses we can only dream of. Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1997, just before Ashley Judd's career took off, she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein, head of the starmaking studio Miramax, at a Beverly Hills hotel. Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,\" Judd says in an interview with TIME. \"Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me. I told him. I told everyone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TIME NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years. It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. \"Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?\" Judd asks. \"There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened. (Weinstein said he \"never laid a glove\" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the \"problem that has no name,\" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #MeToo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM?' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old. ‘ We need to formalize the whisper network. It's an ingenious way that we've tried to keep ourselves safe. All those voices can be amplified. That's my advice to women. That and if something feels wrong, it is wrong—and it's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else's. ’ Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove' on Judd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City's regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They're part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR II NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco's Mission District, a group of women from different worlds met for the first time. Judd, every bit the movie star in towering heels, leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual, a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family. Beside her, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, eight months pregnant, spoke softly with Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento. A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From a distance, these women could not have looked more different. Their ages, their families, their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart. Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe: Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on that November morning, what separated them was less important than what brought them together: a shared experience. Over the course of six weeks, TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries, all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs. They often had eerily similar stories to share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In almost every case, they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself—years of lewd comments, forced kisses, opportunistic gropes—but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances. Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame. Had she somehow asked for it? Could she have deflected it? Was she making a big deal out of nothing? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react?\" says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family's livelihood should her story come out in her small community. \"I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.?\" It's a poisonous, useless thought, she adds, but how do you avoid it? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day. She can still feel the heat of her harasser's hands on her body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag #MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter. ‘ It's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I have not stopped crying. I look at my daughter and think, Please, let this be worth it. Please, let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this. ’ Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence, created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. ‘ Sexual harassment does bring shame. And I think it's really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For some, the fear was born of a threat of physical violence. Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home, but felt she was powerless to stop him. If she told anyone, the abuser warned her, he would come after her or her children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those who are often most vulnerable in society—immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people—described many types of dread. If they raised their voices, would they be fired? Would their communities turn against them? Would they be killed? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 47% of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, both in and out of the workplace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED, HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER.' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them, Blair spoke out about her encounter with him. ‘ I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial. He called the women liars. But their stories were so similar to mine, and they were such credible women. There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story, be free of this story. And in a magazine interview, he called the people who said this about him 'c-nts' and 'c-cksuckers.' That was just wrong. And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out. ’ Toback has denied all allegations of harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls \"feeling the pressure of someone's eyes\" on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. \"Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,\" she recalls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While guests come and go, some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers. Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza, a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite. \"Walking in, it's breathtaking,\" she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then, she says, a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like \"I can tell you had sex last night\" and groping her. One of those encounters was even caught on camera, but the management did not properly respond, her lawyers say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left: Veronica Owusu, Gabrielle Eubank, Crystal Washington, Dana Lewis, Paige Rodriguez, Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault' among employees there. ‘ 'I am a single mother. I have an 11-year-old daughter, and she's depending on me,' says Lewis, who still works at the hotel to make ends meet. 'My entire life revolves around her. I wasn't really left with the option of leaving. I'm not left with the option of giving up. I want to show her that it's O.K. to stand up for yourself. If you keep fighting, eventually you'll see the sun on the other side.' ’ Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel. But she cannot afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she's accused. \"It's a dream to be an employee there,\" Washington says. \"And then you find out what it really is, and it's a nightmare.\" (Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other women, like the actor Selma Blair, weathered excruciating threats. Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room. There, she says, Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down. She took her top off. She says he then propositioned her for sex, and when she refused, he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg. Afterward, she recalls him telling her that if she said anything, he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades. \"I had heard from others that he was slandering me, saying these sexual things about me, and it just made me even more afraid of him,\" Blair says in an interview with TIME. \"I genuinely thought for almost 20 years, He's going to kill me.\" ( Toback has denied the allegations, saying he never met his accusers or doesn't remember them.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear, one less visceral but no less real, as a reason for not speaking out: if you do, your complaint becomes your identity. \"'Susan Fowler, the famous victim of sexual harassment,'\" says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees. \"Nobody wants to be the buzzkill,\" adds Lindsey Reynolds, one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh. (The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect. Besh apologized for \"unacceptable behavior\" and \"moral failings,\" and resigned from the company. ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iwu, the lobbyist, says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event. She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault. The next week, she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government. When she told people about the campaign, she says they were wary. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" they warned her. \"Remember Anita Hill.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment, the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments. ‘ We can't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in. And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it's a member of our own party. ’ Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately. Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her. ‘ I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react? Why couldn't I force words out of my mouth? When I got home, I crumbled. I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.? ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller's lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she'd gotten him fired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,\" she told the lawyer. \"I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine.\" (Mueller said he would appeal.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. \"I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,\" she says, \"imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance.\" Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they'd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHEN I TESTIFIED, I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN'S ATTORNEY BULLY, BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM, INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY.' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013. She reported him to his radio station, KYGO, and he was terminated. He said her accusations were false and sued Swift. She countersued for $1 and won. ‘ In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite? ’ Mueller's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was the great unleashing that turned the #MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry. The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault. A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase, and Milano, almost on a whim, tweeted it out on Oct. 15. \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,\" she wrote, and then went to sleep. She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used #MeToo. Milano burst into tears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment, but the hashtag quickly spread. \"We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender,\" says Burke, who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages. By November, California farmworkers, Pascual among them, were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Women were no longer alone. \"There's something really empowering about standing up for what's right,\" says Fowler, who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower. \"It's a badge of honor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sandra Pezqueda 37 Former Dishwasher More Pezqueda filed a suit alleging that her supervisor at the Terranea Resort, a luxury retreat in South California, pursued her for months. When she rebuffed him, he changed her schedule and cut her hours. ‘ Someone who is in the limelight is able to speak out more easily than people who are poor. The reality of being a woman is the same—the difference is the risk each woman must take. ’ Attorneys for the staffing company that employed Pezqueda deny her allegations. Terranea Resort declined to comment except to say that the suit involves an outside agency. Blaise Godbe Lipman 28 Director More Lipman accused a former agent, Tyler Grasham, of sexually assaulting him when he was 18. Grasham has since been dismissed by his agency and is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. ‘ I experienced a little bit of victim blaming, victim shaming—people digging into my Instagram and pulling up sexy photos, as if that discredited me from speaking out against sexual violence. And gay men are often highly sexualized in the media, so coming out with a story of sexual assault, especially one that also involved alcohol and maybe drugs, there is an idea that 'Well, did you want it?.' ’ Grasham could not be reached for comment. Correction: The original version of this caption incorrectly said Tyler Grasham was Lipman’s agent. Grasham never represented Lipman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR III NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms: harassment becomes \"inappropriate behavior,\" assault becomes ­\"misconduct,\" rape becomes \"abuse.\" We're accustomed to hearing those softened words, which downplay the pain of the experience. That's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt. The language used by the man who would become America's 45th President, captured on a 2005 recording, was, by any standard, vulgar. He didn't just say that he'd made a pass; he \"moved on her like a bitch.\" He didn't just talk about fondling women; he bragged that he could \"grab 'em by the pussy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration. It's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size. \"All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors,\" says Aldon Morris, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. \"In this case, you had Harvey Weinstein, and before that you had Trump.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Megyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. \"I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,\" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. \"But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE.' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room. McGowan's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser. ‘ The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense, especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well. People forget a lot that there's a human behind this, someone who is very hurt. But that's O.K. It fuels my fire. They really f-cked with the wrong person. ’ Weinstein has denied all allegations of non­consensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning \"pussy hats\" and marching on the nation's capital in a show of unity and fury. What was startling was the size of the protest. It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment. She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar. A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office. No matter the outcome, the allegations added fuel to a growing fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By February, the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley, when Fowler spoke out about her \"weird year\" as an engineer at Uber. \"I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\" Fowler says. \"I felt like I had to take action.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barely two months later, Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $13 million to settle claims against him from five women. In October, the Times revealed a sixth settlement, bringing that total to more than $45 million. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and former guest on the network, was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor—but she was initially reluctant to go on the record. \"I was afraid for my kids, I was afraid of the retaliation,\" she says. \"I know what men can do when they're angry.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually she allowed her name to be used. \"I felt it was my duty,\" Walsh says, \"as a mother of daughters, as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced, to be brave.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The downfall of O'Reilly, who has denied all allegations of harassment, would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment. In June, Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand, one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades. Although the case ended in a mistrial—it is scheduled to be retried in April—the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture, a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, Fox News fired him. ‘ In the early '90s, as a news anchor, I wore buttoned-up suits, skirts to my knees, sensible shoes. I dipped out of the industry. When I came back, I was put in a sausage dress. The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher. Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter: any woman, even a woman with advanced degrees, would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy. Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room. ’ O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues. Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh, Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company's culture of sexism. She later filed a complaint with the EEOC. Besh has since stepped down. ‘ After I sent that email, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking. I was nobody. I'm just a person from a small town in Texas. I have no money, no power, no social standing. And they have more power and money than I will ever have. I felt extremely vulnerable and scared. Then I heard from women I had never met—they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate—who had experienced the same toxic culture. ’ The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect. Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable' behavior and 'moral failings,' and resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Complaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia. The chief executive of SoFi, the $4 billion lending firm, resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment. Then, in early October, the dam finally broke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Oct. 5, the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser, as a serial sexual predator. The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks. Weinstein denied the allegations, but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed. Fellow chieftains refused to defend him. Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations. His company's board fired him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days, the head of Amazon Studios, an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims. By the end of the month, the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin, a former TIME employee; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier; and numerous politicians and journalists. The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME. I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers. ‘ I was afraid. When the man was harassing me, he threatened to harm my children and me—that's why I kept quiet. I felt desperate. I cried and cried. But, thank God, my friends in the fields support me. So I said, Enough. I lost the fear. It doesn't matter if they criticize me. I can support other people who are going through the same thing. ’ *Pascual's name was changed to protect her family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward. In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28–30, 82% of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations. Meanwhile, 85% say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movement—and fallout—quickly spread around the world. Michael Fallon, Britain's Defense Secretary, quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had \"lunged\" at her in 2003, when she was a 29-year-old reporter. In France, women took to the streets chanting not only \"Me too\" but also \"Balance ton porc ,\" which translates roughly to \"Expose your pig,\" a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller. In the week after #MeToo first surfaced, versions of it swept through 85 countries, from India, where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years, to the Middle East, Asia and parts in between. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who invested in her first company, harassed her. After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck, he resigned from his firm. ‘ I wanted it to stop. I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed, called, text-messaged. That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury—because I didn't want it to be a big deal. For so long, I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way. And now I see that that is so silly. I am a person with dignity. ’ Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable.' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working. ‘ One time when I was cleaning, a guest asked me if I knew how to massage. I said, 'No, I don't even do it to my husband.' The way he was looking at me wasn't friendly. I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there. It's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room, they are paying for sexual service. ’ The hotel declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Suddenly,\" says Terry Reintke, a German member of the European Parliament, who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25, \"friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By November, the spotlight was back on American politicians. A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate, abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore, including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers. Moore has called the allegations \"false\" and \"malicious.\" \"Specifically, I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman,\" he said in late November. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END.' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France, Muller started the Twitter hashtag #BalanceTonPorc (Expose Your Pig), which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment. ‘ France is a country of love, but there is love and love, you know? There are ways to approach a woman, and if it's done with respect, it's O.K. Without respect, it's not good. Now if men want your love, they have to ask themselves how to be, how to approach a woman. They are scared. We must restart all relationships from the beginning. We have to cleanse society to find a better way. I'm sure the road will be long and difficult, but it will be positive in the end. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The following week, radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006, before he was in office. Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken, who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior. On Dec. 5, Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff. He has said that the allegations \"are not accurate; they are not true.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Texas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014. Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral. Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees. ‘ When other women spoke out, they were retaliated against. So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid: 'I'm not going to sue, because they'll make me sign a non­disclosure agreement. I'm not going to do press right afterward, because they'll say I'm doing it for attention. I can't have any emotion in my blog. I have to be very, very detached.' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation, so it couldn't be 'he said, she said.' And that's what I did. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The accused were both Democrats and Republicans, but the consequences thus far have been limited—and often filtered through a partisan lens. In politics, at least, what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe. In the 1990s, feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his ­accusers—a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President. And despite the allegations against Moore, both ­President Trump and the Republican National Committee support him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll, which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party. The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign (71% and 74% respectively), when the accused offender was in the GOP, only 54% of Republicans would demand a resignation (compared to 82% of Democrats). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE? LET'S FLIP IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING.' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault. Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event. Venit was briefly suspended from the agency. ‘ People were saying, 'You should have beaten him up.' I'm like, Why is nobody questioning him? Nobody questions the predator. You know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, 'No more.' Why are you questioning the victim here? Let's flip it. Let's talk about what the predator is doing. ’ The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit, who declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As another election cycle approaches, Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression. Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope, a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms. There wasn't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there, Carmita Wood, filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her. The university denied her claim, arguing that she left the job for \"personal reasons.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd (right) and Jessica Cantlon (left), along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department, filed complaints with the university and the EEOC, alleging harassment and retaliation. ‘ 'If they couldn't stop us from talking, they were going to stop every­body from listening,' says Cantlon. 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us. But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint. I think working together was powerful. It was hard to silence all of us.' ’ The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wood, joined by activists from the university's human-affairs program, formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields, from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants, to talk about their own harassment experiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we're seeing today, encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone. But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow, legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent. In the 1970s, most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever, and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME.' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior. She had. In 2016, Kelly revealed that she'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. ‘ I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter. I never thought things could change for me. Never. I believed the system was stacked against women, and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I'm starting to see it so differently. What if we did complain? What if we didn't whine, but insisted that those around us did better? ’ Ailes denied Kelly's claims of harassment before he died in May. O'Reilly said he didn't know of any complaint by Kelly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It was a victory, but with caveats: even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal, it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck—in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define. What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition, interpretation has evolved slowly, shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue. But, she says, \"The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace. It was about the fallout in politics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More From left: Jane Merrick, journalist; Zelda Perkins, producer; Terry Reintke, Parliament member; Bex Bailey, charity worker. ‘ Britain's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged' at her when she was a young reporter: 'I think we're all part of this movement. On Twitter, there aren't any country borders, because it's such a powerful thing. There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country.” ’ Fallon said in a statement that he's 'behaved inappropriately in the past.' Kate Peters for TIME NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even now, the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky. Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line, like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap. But others feel more ambiguous. Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris, who specializes in workplace training, says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves. \"It's more like, 'I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice, I wonder when it's O.K. to give a hug, I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room,'\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment. ‘ The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City. I was trying to figure out my place in the art world, my place in the city, my place as an adult in the workplace. The harassment began so early, and it was so accepted in the industry. When I finally spoke out publicly, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. I was afraid that I didn't have the strength to make it stop. I don't feel that fear anymore. ’ Artforum's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt. Landesman could not be reached for comment. Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California's capital, which launched a state-senate investigation. ‘ Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago. And all I did was participate in the whisper network: 'Here's what you can wear,' 'Here's where you can go,' 'Here's who to avoid.' But you have to address it head on and as a group. It's hard to call 147 women liars. We can't all be crazy. We can't all be sluts. ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This uncertainty can be corrosive. While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists, there is a risk that the net may be cast too far. What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee? Neither should be encouraged, but nor should they be equated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep up. Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment, and many have anti–sexual harassment training programs and claim to be \"zero-­tolerance workplaces.\" A 2016 EEOC report found that a company's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers—high-performing men like Kalanick, Weinstein and O'Reilly—to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-­suites and corporate boards overlooked harassment. It doesn't matter how good a company's policy is if its systems are ignored or don't work. \"So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office ,\" says Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the EEOC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some instances, sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire. In a 2001 study, Lisa Scherer, an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment, it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture. \"What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect,\" she says. \"They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Employers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits. The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15% increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017. And Advisen, which tracks insurance trends, says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30% since 2011, which indicates that more companies are reporting losses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corporate boards, wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press, have been among the quickest to make changes. Uber, for example, which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms, used to be a guiding light for small startups. Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber, says Fowler. \"There's a shift to, 'We're not disrupting anymore. We're trying to build something that's good for consumers and treats employees fairly.'\" It's a start. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local governments have also taken some concrete steps. In October, the Chicago city council passed an ordinance­ requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms. In Springfield, Ill., lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-­harassment complaints in the statehouse. In Arizona, pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS.' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her, this young Native American woman says she felt trapped. Her office had no HR department. She didn't feel her colleagues or family on her small, conservative reservation would believe her. So she quit her job. ‘ On the reservation, we keep to ourselves and don't really put too much out there. I thought of all the other people that had no voice. They're scared to do something like this because their parents say, 'You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to speak up.' ’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the federal level, the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training. A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements—legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason, including sexual harassment. Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman reached out to prosecutors last week asking to testify, and she did so with such a deliberate and severe tone, shying away from none of the injustices she and her fellow athletes have endured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early in her statement, she appeared to look at Nassar himself, and said coldly: “You do realize now the women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time are now a force, and you are nothing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She responded to a statement Nassar provided yesterday, telling the judge he was unsure if he had the mental stamina to listen to so many victim impact statements. Raisman did not mince words, telling her abuser that he is “pathetic to think that anyone would have sympathy for you.” She told Nassar that she and the other athletes he abused “will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: A life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Raisman’s most focused contempt came for USA Gymnastics and the USOC, and how they allowed the state of the sport to be uniquely influenced by Nassar. Both institutions received complaints about his abuses spanning back decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told Nassar that she “will not rest until every last trace of your influence on this sport has been destroyed like the cancer it is,” and, in addressing new USA Gymastics CEO Kerry Perry, said she had “taken on an organization that I feel is rotting from the inside.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This may not be what you thought you were getting into,” she said, “but you will be judged by how you deal with it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman is clearly fed up with the USAG’s toothless statements and responses to the growing crisis within its sport, saying that “continuing to issue statements of empty promises thinking that will pacify us will no longer work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She begged USA Gymnastics and the USOC to conduct full and independent investigations into how Nassar’s abuses were allowed to go on for so long, and clean out any and all people who failed to protect her and her fellow gymnasts.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The tables have turned Larry,\" she said. \"We are here.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Where is the honesty? Where is the transparency? Why must the manipulation continue?\" she asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gymnast's statement came on the fourth day of a remarkable weeklong sentencing for Nassar , the former doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He has pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County, Michigan, and admitted to sexually assaulting and abusing young girls under the guise of providing medical treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman, who won three gold medals for the US women's gymnastics team in 2012 and 2016, said Friday that she represented USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee at two Olympics, but they had not reciprocated.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the victims -- or survivors, as they have also been called in court -- have reserved harsh words for Nassar, who they said used his power and professional renown in the sports community for his own sexual gratification. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they have also targeted institutions that they say enabled Nassar for more than two decades. USA Gymnastics and Michigan State have separately said they reported Nassar's abuse immediately when they learned about it, but a number of victims said they told authorities about the abuse years ago and were ignored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Michigan State University, the school I loved and trusted, had the audacity to tell me that I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,\" Amanda Thomashow said at sentencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That master manipulator took advantage of his title, he abused me, and when I found the strength to talk about what had happened, I was ignored and my voice was silenced.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That criticism has not gone unheard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi Ranch , the women's gymnastics training facility where gymnasts said abuse went unchecked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And on Friday, Michigan State's Board of Trustees asked the Michigan attorney general to review the Nassar case, according to a statement CNN obtained.

Gorka was unable to get clearance for the national security council after he was charged last year with carrying a weapon at Ronald Reagan Washington national airport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian reported in April that Gorka attempted to push a plan to partition Libya into three as part of an effort to be named special envoy to the country by Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite his lack of a security clearance, Gorka has served as a prominent Trump surrogate on cable news, accusing critics of promoting “fake news” and touting that with Trump’s election, “there’s a new sheriff in town.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent weeks, one White House source told the Washington Examiner that Gorka’s role had diminished to the point where he was appearing on television, “giving White House tours and peeling out in his Mustang.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official spoke anonymously to discuss private personnel matters. Attempts to reach Gorka by email for comment were not immediately successful.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A member of President Trump’s administration was among the thousands of people who brought firearms to Transportation Security Administration checkpoints (TSA) last year, according to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sebastian L. Gorka, a senior White House adviser who lives in Fairfax County, Va., was busted in February last year for allegedly taking a 9 mm pistol through a TSA checkpoint at Reagan National Airport. Gorka’s weapon was confiscated by Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) police, and he was slapped with a misdemeanor state charge of carrying a weapon in the airport, according to Virginia court records and the TSA. The TSA didn’t say whether the firearm was loaded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The TSA, following its usual protocol, didn’t identify Gorka by name in its news release about the Feb. 1, 2016, gun catch. But when a brief article appeared in The Washington Post at the time, readers posted comments identifying Gorka straight off as the national security editor for Breitbart news and also chimed in with some nyah, nyah, nyahs. No doubt more are now wondering how someone who is supposed to be thinking about national security could forget he had a firearm in his bag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that one of President Trump’s picks for a senior White House position had been charged with trying to bring a gun through a TSA checkpoint, noted that the criminal charge wouldn’t necessarily disqualify Gorka from obtaining a security clearance unless he failed to disclose it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sebastian Gorka, who has joined the Trump White House staff, faced a weapons charge in Virginia after allegedly attempting to pass a TSA checkpoint at Reagan National Airport last year with a gun in his bag. (Breitbart.com) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arlington County Circuit Court records show that Gorka, 46, was charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor, which carries penalties of up to a year in jail and a fine of no more than $2,500. He entered an Alford plea — which means a defendant acknowledges that prosecutors have enough evidence to obtain a conviction — on Aug. 8, records say. Adjudication was set for next week (Feb. 3). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gorka, who was reached at the White House on Friday, declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Odd but true stories of how travelers “forgot\" about having guns in their carry-ons] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it comes to visiting TSA checkpoints with firearms, Gorka is just another face in the crowd. The TSA found a record 3,391 firearms in carry-ons in 2016, up from 2,653 in 2015, the previous record. Most of the firearms were loaded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The increase in firearm seizures at TSA checkpoints no doubt has something to do with the record number of people flying — and the significant expansion in the number of people who have permits to carry concealed firearms. (The Crime Prevention Research Center says the number of concealed-carry permits has more than doubled to 14.5 million since 2007.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Want to speed your way through a TSA checkpoint? Leave your knives at home.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, James L. McGaugh, a professor of neurobiology and behavior at the University of California, who has studied memory formation, said in an interview last year that it’s hard to fathom how anyone could forget he’s carrying a firearm, let alone one that’s loaded. Speaking about the issue in general, McGaugh sounded a little skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And they can get away with it, on the grounds of saying, ‘Oh, my gosh I forgot to take the damn thing out,’ ” McGaugh said. “Suppose I had a pipe bomb in my suitcase?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our memories are shaped by the way that we perceive an event or how much emotional energy it carries, he said. Adrenaline, for example, tends to make memories stick with people. And yet the best explanation he has for why people bring firearms to airport checkpoints is that people can become habituated to almost anything — and when they do, they tend to let it recede to the far reaches of the mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For me a loaded gun would create a very strong memory,” McGaugh said. “Did a loaded gun make a strong memory for Al Capone? I don’t think so. He was used to it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it’s possible that carrying a loaded Glock might not register much more than wearing a pair of socks — but, arguably, that’s also a form of complacency that can lead to problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A remote possibility is these people no longer think these things are dangerous,” McGaugh said. “It’s like the person who drives 90 mph — it’s the other person who’s going to get killed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [More odd but true stories about travelers who “forgot\" they had guns in their carry-ons] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The TSA has undertaken several campaigns to educate air travelers on the proper way to transport firearms. But it could also do more to deter violators. For one thing, the agency could ask Congress for stricter penalties or persuade prosecutors to come down harder on violators. They could also stop shielding the identifies of people who are charged. It took Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain the basic arrest data on people arrested in 2016 — and the MWAA police, in complying, initially passed along documents so heavily redacted as to be useless. Identifying violators might be a small way to remind people: “Don’t be that guy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s what the TSA had to say about that, through a spokeswoman: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While Congress determines federal law regarding the transport of firearms aboard commercial aircraft, TSA works closely with local law enforcement to enforce regulations regarding firearms brought to the checkpoint in carry-on baggage. Although local officials are solely responsible for the enforcement of state and local laws regarding firearms, TSA initiates civil proceedings resulting in fines. Additionally, if applicable, TSA Precheck privileges are revoked for TSA Precheck members who attempt to bring, whether knowingly or not, firearms through the checkpoint.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s another thing we’ve become habituated to: people bringing guns to checkpoints.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to Donald Trump under pressure over his past ties with Hungarian far-right groups, suggested the idea of partition in the weeks leading up to the US president’s inauguration, according to an official with knowledge of the matter. The European diplomat responded that this would be “the worst solution” for Libya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gorka is vying for the job of presidential special envoy to Libya in a White House that has so far spent little time thinking about the country and has yet to decide whether to create such a post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Libya has been mired in a conflict between two competing governments since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 after a Nato-led intervention. As rival jostle for influence and position in Washington on the hitherto neglected issue, sharp differences have emerged over how much say Russia should have in Libya’s fate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are fears among some European allies that the White House will reverse the Obama administration’s strong support for the UN-backed Libyan government of national accord, which is based in Tripoli and led by Fayez al-Sarraj. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the GNA has been seen by some as the best option for achieving stability in the country, it has struggled against a rival government based in Tobruk, eastern Libya, backed by Khalifa Haftar, an anti-Islamist military strongman. Haftar, who would not back partition, has support in some parts of the Egyptian and Russian governments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, he was welcomed onboard the Admiral Kuznetsov, the Russian flagship, as the aircraft carrier sailed along the north African coast. Haftar, a 73-year-old field marshal and former Gaddafi general who later became his bitter opponent, presents himself as a bulwark against Islamism and the Muslim Brotherhood, which makes him appealing to elements of the Trump foreign policy team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gorka advocates hardline policies aimed at defeating “radical Islam” and sees the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group bent on infiltrating the US. As a former Breitbart editor, he is close to Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, who believes the struggle against radical Islam should be the central theme of US foreign policy. But Bannon’s star is on the wane in the White House and he lost his seat on the national security council last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gorka has alarmed foreign diplomats with his views on Libya’s future. The map he drew on a napkin during the transition period cut Libya into three sections, apparently based on the old Ottoman provinces of Cyrenaica in the east, Tripolitania in the north-west and Fezzan in the south-west. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mattia Toaldo, a Libya expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: “This is like a litmus test of how much you know about Libya. If the only thing you know is that it was cut into three, then it shows you are clueless about the situation in Libya.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gorka’s rivals for the envoy job include Pete Hoekstra, a former congressman and lobbyist, and Phillip Escaravage, a former US intelligence official who worked on Libya for more than a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Escaravage is generally considered to be the clear favourite to take on the unpaid role. He is believed to have put forward a peace proposal heavily dependent on tens of billions of dollars in western financial support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least one European ally has privately expressed frustration at the US state department’s lack of a position on Libya, voicing concerns over Russia’s growing influence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While separatists who support partition claim that a viable state could be built in eastern Libya, most experts agree that the move would stoke another civil war because the boundaries would be hotly disputed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives of the Tobruk government, including Haftar, have sought to influence the Trump administration, calling for the US to radically change its position and withdraw support for the Sarraj government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a phone interview with the Guardian, Ari Ben-Menashe, an Israeli security consultant based in Canada, whose company has a $6m (£4.9m) contract to lobby on behalf of Haftar and Aguila Saleh Issa, the head of the Libyan house of representatives in Tobruk, said the White House had been “briefed” on Libya and was “willing to play on our terms”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contact the Guardian securely Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is not going to be a partition,” Ben-Menashe said. “None of them [Trump administration officials] really knew anything about what was going on.

The Trump administration, he added, was “interested in getting the help of Russians and interested in getting them to resolve it”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Support for the eastern government was growing in parts of Europe, including the UK, Ben-Menashe said. “We have talked to the Brits, the Norwegians, the Swiss.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seventy-two scientists and engineers from 16 institutions around the world collaborated to confirm element 117's existence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the ingredients in this heavy metal recipe are challenging: the 13-milligram berkelium 249 sample used in the study took 18 months to synthesize, and with a half-life of only 330 days, once the sample was created the race was on.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research, an accelerator laboratory located in Darmstadt, Germany, say they have created and observed several atoms of element 117, which is temporarily named ununseptium.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the years, researchers have created heavier and heavier elements in hopes of discovering just how large atoms can be, said Christoph Düllmann, a professor at the Institute for Nuclear Chemistry at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. Is there a limit, for instance, to the number of protons that can be packed into an atomic nucleus? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are predictions that super-heavy elements should exist which are very long-lived,\" Düllmann told Live Science. \"It is interesting to find out if half-lives become long again for very heavy elements, especially if very neutron-rich species are made.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Typically, the more protons and neutrons are added into an atomic nucleus, the more unstable an atom becomes. Most super-heavy elements last just microseconds or nanoseconds before decaying. Yet, scientists have predicted that an \"island of stability\" exists where super-heavy elements become stable again. If such an \"island\" exists, the elements in this theoretical region of the periodic table could be extremely long-lived — capable of existing for longer than nanoseconds — which scientists could then develop for untold practical uses, the researchers said. (A half-life refers to the time it takes for half of a substance to decay.)

{"context": "This move is certainly not out of the blue -- incorporating social media information into immigrant records in one way or another has been a topic of conversation for a while. In 2015, the DHS began working on a plan to add social media searches into visa application protocol and in 2016 it proposed and implemented a new section in the travel form for foreign visitors coming to the US under the visa waiver program that asks for social media handles. In February, the DHS announced that it was planning to start asking visitors from Trump's travel ban list of countries for not only their social account names, but their passwords as well. And in March reports came out that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ordered social media checks on all visa applicants who had visited ISIS-controlled regions. Additionally, after proposing the plan in May, the Trump administration introduced an expanded visa applicant questionnaire in June that asks for all social media handles used in the last five years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In regards to the new DHS rule, Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Adam Schwartz told BuzzFeed, \"There's a growing trend at the Department of Homeland Security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants and foreigners and we think it's an invasion of privacy and deters freedom of speech.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new rule is open for public comment until October 18th when it will officially be implemented. ||||| \"There's a growing trend at the Department of Homeland Security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON — Federal officials are planning to collect social media information on all immigrants, including permanent residents and naturalized citizens, a move that has alarmed lawyers and privacy groups worried about how the information will be used. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published the new rule in the Federal Register last week, saying it wants to include \"social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\" as part of people's immigration file. The new requirement takes effect Oct. 18. Adam Schwartz, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for privacy and free expression, said the plan was disturbing. \"We see this as part of a larger process of high-tech surveillance of immigrants and more and more people being subjected to social media screening,\" Schwartz told BuzzFeed News. \"There's a growing trend at the Department of Homeland Security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants and foreigners and we think it's an invasion of privacy and deters freedom of speech.\" This would also affect all US citizens who communicate with immigrants, Schwartz said, who could self-censor out of fear that information they exchange with someone overseas could be misconstrued and used against them. DHS said the amendment posted last week is not a new policy. It was added in an effort to be transparent, to comply with existing regulations, and due to updates in the electronic immigration system the agency said. \"DHS published this notice in the Federal Register on Sept. 18 to comply with the administrative requirements of the Privacy Act to help address these requirements, not launch a new policy initiative,\" the agency said. \"DHS, in its law-enforcement and immigration-process capacity, has and continues to monitor publicly-available social media to protect the homeland.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Faiza Patel, codirector of the Brennan Center’s liberty and national security program, said this is yet another fad, started by the Obama administration, fueled by the belief that social media is going to help the US stop an attack in the country. \"It's very difficult to successfully use social media to determine what people are going or not going to do,\" Patel told BuzzFeed News. \"When you look at all the different ways in which we use communication tools, and social media is pretty different, very truncated. People use emojis, they use short form, sometimes it’s difficult to know what something means.\" In February the Office of Inspector General published a report that found DHS pilot programs for using social media to screen applicants for immigration benefits lacked criteria to determine if it’s effective. Another concern, Patel said, is that the information would be used for ideological vetting by the US government who will be looking at people's political and personal views of people abroad and in the US. \"The question is do we really want the government monitoring political views?\" Patel said. \"Social media may not be able to predict violence but it can certainly tell you a lot about a person's political and religious views.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, said the expansion seems to originate from concerns about Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino shooters in late 2015. “This is another example of the government changing security protocols based on a previous incident that will impose an enormous cost and that is of dubious value for the future,” Nowrasteh said. “Social media has been used in immigration courts for years but there’s little evidence that it’s helped with visa vetting.” The Trump administration has had an interest in how immigration authorities use social media despite there being no evidence to show it was reliable, according to USCIS presidential transition records. “Yesterday at our briefing with the President-Elect’s Landing Team, one of the things they mentioned they’d be interested in seeing was guidance that we use regarding social media use and when/how we can use social media,” wrote a senior adviser in December. In documents provided to the transition team, the agency said no immigration benefits had been denied solely or primarily because of information uncovered through social media vetting. “In cases of benefit denial, the denial was based on information found outside of social media,” the document said. Three refugee pilot programs to screen social media found that although they were able to find refugees accounts the information did not produce clear links to national security concerns even for applicants who were found to pose a national security threat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, assistant professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said DHS has a lot of discretion in how it treats information when making a decision on immigration benefits, even if its reliability is questionable. \"The fact that information gleaned from Facebook or Instagram or other social media networks might not be reliable doesn't mean that it will preclude DHS from using it as a basis for excluding people from the United States,\" García Hernández said. Still, García Hernández said, it's important to remember that it's unusual for DHS to decide whether to allow someone into the US based on a single piece of information. \"Folks might share a post on social media that seems ripe for government officials to use as the hook for a conversation that starts to resemble an ideological purity test,\" García Hernández said. There is also the possibility that someone may be hacked and will be held to task for a post or comment, García Hernández said. \"Having government oversight with the potential for life-changing adverse consequences when it comes to social media use by prospective immigrants is a pretty direct affront to the longstanding promotion of free speech that's at the core of the US constitution,\" García Hernández said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Globe story also gave a full account of the Romney campaign’s position that, notwithstanding several years of regulatory filings, Mitt Romney “retired from Bain Capital in 1999 … (and) has had no involvement in the management or investment activities of Bain Capital, or with any of its portfolio companies, since that time.” In your correction request, you reiterate points that are fully detailed in the Globe story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sincerely, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martin Baron NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Editor, The Boston Globe ||||| New evidence for when Romney really left Bain Capital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FORTUNE -- Mitt Romney did not manage Bain Capital's investments after leaving to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games, according to confidential firm documents obtained by Fortune. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The timing of Romney's departure from Bain became a lightning rod earlier today, when The Boston Globe published an article suggesting that Romney remained actively involved with the firm longer than he and his campaign have claimed. The sourcing is largely SEC documents that list Romney as Bain Capital's CEO and sole shareholder through 2002 -- or three years after Romney officially left to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These claims are very similar to ones made last week by David Corn in Mother Jones, which we disputed at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Fortune has obtained new evidence that supports Romney's version of events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bain Capital began circulating offering documents for its seventh private equity fund in June 2000. Those documents include several pages specifying fund management. The section begins: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Set forth below is information regarding the background of the senior private equity investment professionals of Bain Capital. Also listed are certain investment professionals responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Brookside and Sankaty funds, which are affiliated funds of Fund VII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It then goes on to list 18 managers of the private equity fund. Mitt Romney is not among them. Same goes for an affiliated co-investment fund, whose private placement memorandum is dated September 2000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then there is Bain Capital Venture Fund -- the firm's first dedicated venture capital effort -- whose private placement memorandum is dated January 2001. Romney also isn't listed among its \"key investment professionals,\" or as part of its day-to-day operations or investment committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of this could prove problematic for the Obama campaign, which has spent the day crowing over the Globe story (going so far as to hold a media call about it). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When Mitt Romney ran for governor and now as he's running for president, he consistently claimed he could not be blamed for bankruptcies and layoffs from Bain investments after February 1999 because he departed for the Olympics,\" said Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter, according to the Globe. \"Now, we know that he wasn't telling the truth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the contemporaneous Bain documents show that Romney was indeed telling the truth about no longer having operational input at Bain -- which, one should note, is different from no longer having legal or financial ties to the firm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Fortune wrote earlier, Romney left Bain suddenly -- rather than as part of an organized transition plan -- after being asked to lead an Olympic organizing committee that had spiraled out of control. Moreover, it was unclear in February 1999 if Romney's leave of absence would be permanent, or if he would return (as he had in 1994, after losing a U.S.Senate race to Ted Kennedy). He didn't formally give up his title and firm ownership until 2002, once the Games had been successful and he was interested in other elective office. In the interim, he continued to fulfill legal obligations such as signing certain documents -- but actual investment and managerial decisions were being made by others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After being informed of the Bain Capital documents, Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt emailed over the following statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Mitt Romney either misled the American people or misrepresented himself to the SEC. Romney has said he had no authority or responsibility for managing Bain since 1999, but that has been proven false. Regardless of whether he was on the management committee for this particular deal, he remained President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board and he was legally responsible for every investment and decision made by Bain.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sign up for Dan's daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com"}
{"context": "(TNS) -- A small band of cyber jihadi hunters — including former members of the hacktivist group Anonymous — has been quietly feeding the feds online intel that’s foiled more than 10 terror plots and identified scores of ISIS recruiters and websites, on a mission that’s acquired new urgency in the wake of the Paris attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We felt enough wasn’t being done, so we wanted to put our skills to good use,” said the executive director of Ghost Security Group, who only goes by the online hacker name DigitaShadow after numerous ISIS death threats. “We’re completely independent. We survive off donations alone.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security Group has provided valuable information since June, according to Michael S. Smith II, co-founder of defense contractor Kronos Advisory and a former adviser to a Congressional terrorism task force. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith said he became the de facto middleman between the hackers and the feds after members of Ghost Security Group saw him quoted in a newspaper article about cyber terrorism earlier this year and reached out for help because they weren’t sure their data was getting through the FBI’s tip line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When they first reached out, I wasn’t sure if they were just enthusiastic people who wanted to help,” Smith told the Herald. “I was soon pleasantly surprised.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security Group sent him screen shots several weeks later with communications about a plot targeting British and Jewish bystanders at an open-air market in Tunisia popular with tourists. The information was used to disrupt a terror cell and prevent a July 4 terrorist attack, Smith said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When you look at what happened with the Tunisia data, they literally saved lives,” said Smith. “That’s what’s remarkable — that a small group of people can have that kind of impact.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In July, Smith said he showed authorities the group’s information on planned suicide attacks in Saudi Arabia. Smith said it’s unclear how the authorities used or shared that data, but within 24 hours, Saudi forces arrested hundreds of ISIS members in a sweep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group has also identified dozens of ISIS recruiters and provided pivotal data showing terrorists moving from Twitter to the Telegram messaging app, according to Smith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s not that the government is incapable of doing this,” said Smith. “The use of the Internet by the Islamic State is so unprecedented in scope, so prolific that it’s frankly overwhelmed the system. There’s a need for more eyes than are available inside government at this point. I would say they are receptive to help.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI declined the Herald’s request for comment on the group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DigitaShadow says he works 16-hour days and his group has taken down more than 100,000 Twitter accounts, nearly 150 websites and 6,000 videos connected to ISIS. They also vet tips on ghostsecuritygroup.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security Group first tries to alert companies whose servers may unwittingly host terrorist websites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If they don’t listen to us within a week, we shut it down by force,” he said. “Anything with intelligence value, we leave intact.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group formed in January after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Some members of Ghost Security Group met through Anonymous — although DigitaShadow stresses they have since broken all ties with Anonymous and operate under a set leadership structure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the 14 members, who work from the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, are men and women ages 25 to 50. Some have military backgrounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group also quietly alerts the feds when they go undercover in ISIS forums, Smith said — a distinction that sets it apart from Anonymous, the loosely organized underground group that also stepped up its war against the Islamic State this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Anonymous may go out and do the same thing — create handles and engage with Islamic State members online — and they are going to be misidentified as terrorists,” said Smith. “And the federal authorities are going to waste time and money monitoring Anonymous when they could be spending time on others.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ©2015 the Boston Herald. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. ||||| In July, a threat emerged from an ISIS-associated Twitter account with few followers. The account alluded to an upcoming terror attack at a beach resort in Tunisia. Just a month before, a similar attack left 38 dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It may have gone undetected if it weren't for a rogue hacker group called Ghost Security Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group, which is made up of counterintelligence officials and computer specialists, had been monitoring the Twitter account for a month. While the under-the-radar account only had a handful of followers, many of them were high-profile ISIS members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hacktivist group immediately looked for intelligence contractors who could relay the info to the authorities. They found terrorist analyst Michael S. Smith II through Twitter. Smith, who works at defense consulting firm Kronos Advisory, serves as a counterterrorism adviser to members of Congress and was responsive to Ghost Security. He became the group's conduit to authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Smith, investigators used Ghost Security's info to identify a target site, who they were targeting, and how they would execute the attack. The investigation ended with the arrest of more than a dozen terror suspects, Smith said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Without a doubt, this group has saved lives. At least into the dozens,\" Smith told CNNMoney. \"There are people working in the national security community in the United States, Europe, the Middle East ... who will never be credited with that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FBI Director James Comey has repeatedly said that ISIS' use of social media is unprecedented in terms of how aggressively it engages with people in the West. Its members are essentially overwhelming the system, Smith said, which means there's room for outside support from groups like Global Security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in order for these groups to be effective, they have to coordinate with those who \"have the mandates ... to find, finish and fix the enemy,\" said Smith. (The FBI would not comment on Ghost Security's involvement in digitally tracking terrorists.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Top questions asked on the ISIS help desk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security differentiates itself from the vast and often disjointed hacktivist collective Anonymous, which has also declared war on ISIS and claims to have taken down pro-ISIS Twitter accounts. A handful of members were previously part of Anonymous, including one of the leaders, who goes by the name \"DigitaShadow.\" He says Ghost Security is small and more focused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have structure and leadership,\" he told CNNMoney. \"We also have a lot of counterterrorism experience. We have translators, linguists, research analysts on hand to analyze all the data that we receive.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DigitaShadow has taken on the role of executive director and helps organize and assign tasks to the 14 members of Ghost Security who are scattered around the world. He also provides electronic equipment for the group. Ghost Security also works with another group, CtrlSec, which helps monitor the social media of terrorists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security was formed following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris last January. DigitaShadow said it's a full time job for the members, who are scattered around the world. Even though they're just volunteers, they work an average of 16 hours a day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We realized for the first time, you could be [attacked] in the streets of Paris and attacked in [your] hometown in America,\" DigitaShadow said. \"Everybody could become a victim. So we wanted to do what we could to help slow them down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Terrorists hide plans by 'going dark' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DigitaShadow says Ghost Security has taken down 149 Islamic State propaganda sites, 110,000 social media accounts, and over 6,000 propaganda videos since it formed. Following the most recent attacks in Paris, the crew is trying to gather intel on the attackers' digital footprints and identify social media accounts involved in the attacks. (CNN could not independently confirm this information.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghost Security claims to have created automated software that identifies ISIS social media accounts. DigitaShadow says the collective has also infiltrated private ISIS communications, taken over ISIS social media accounts and pulled IP information to help identify and locate ISIS members. Ghost Security is primarily focused on bringing down ISIS, but they also target other Islamic extremists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Smith, the group also identified and traced two brothers in Saudi Arabia who filmed themselves executing someone to demonstrate their support for ISIS. The group was able to take control of the Twitter account that uploaded the execution video and find information about the mobile device, which allowed authorities to locate the killers. (The two brothers were killed before U.S. intelligence acted on the information, according to Smith.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After connecting with Smith this summer and funneling information to officials, the group changed some of its tactics to operate more lawfully -- it now sees itself as gathering valuable data to send to authorities. While Smith says operations are done legally, there's a fine line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Is hacking illegal? Absolutely,\" DigitaShadow said. \"Is fighting ISIS to try to stop threats and stop their propaganda -- would that be considered illegal? It falls into a giant gray area.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ghost Security team is working around the clock. They aren't compensated but do receive some bitcoin donations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite struggling to make ends meet, DigitaShadow says they won't stop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we were to stop now, lives would be at risk. It's not a choice, it's more of a way of life for us now.\""}

If that's not a serendipitous shuffle, I don't know what is. It put a smile on my face, or would have, if Beyond Heaving Bosoms: A Smart Bitches Guide to Romance Novels hadn't already pasted a smile there from the very first page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What joy this book has been to read! A few points: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -Chapter names of AWESOMENESS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right from the start, BHB begins as it means to go on by kicking chapter numbers to the curb and giving us chapter names made of pure brilliance. From chapter Cleavage through chapters Secret Cowboy Baby and Love Grotto, I loved them all. My favorite, however, had to be chapter Phallus, not just for the name (though, c'mon) but for its content, part of which was a serious look at the inner working of the genre and the ways in which it hamstrings itself in the larger publishing world. Which brings me to... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -Niceness and what it means for policing one's own genre NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I stand firmly with the Smart Bitches on this one, plagiarism is not sexy. Nor is it something to overlook or gloss over in the name of \"Can't we all just get along?\". This isn't a Ladies Aid Society meeting in 1810, people. It's not about making nice in order to save face in society. Your work had better be your own goddamn work, and your attributions regarding the work of others had better be writ large and unambiguous. In a genre that's long been under siege as worthless trash, nothing signals the larger literary world that you STILL aren't ready for the big kids' table than circling the wagons around an obvious plagiarist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And no amount of, \"the author didn't know better\" or \"if it's on the Internet, (or public domain) it's not really stealing\" will change that. Plagiarism isn't new. You know what you've written and what you haven't, full stop. And saying that things published online are fair game for poaching is like saying that pilfering your neighbor's outdoor holiday decorations is acceptable because, \"they were out there in public, so that must mean they're free to take.\" It's bullshit and everyone knows it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -Old school romance, its lingering stigma and romance as a denigrated genre NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is where I admit that, while I used to read romance novels for the pure fun of finding the sex scenes amid the implausible plot devices, I stopped reading them in my early 20s. I stopped because that was the heyday of the Rapist Hero and after a time I just found the idea of rape-is-a-gateway-to-romance all too oppressive and vile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, that image of romance novels persists to this very day. It's part of the easy dismissal the genre gets from, well, pretty much every other genre out there. \"Hey, I my read ______,\" the reader says. \"But at least I don't read crappy bodice rippers/lady porn/your epithet here.\" As if implausible plots and sex scenes only existed in one genre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Happily, the Smart Bitches are here to exorcise the ghosts of plot devices past, and boy do they ever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -It's okay to love books about love, sex and sexuality NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Really, it is. Like the old school Hero rampaging across the Heroines personal landscape, the common idea is that emotions are weak, therefore anything that celebrates emotions (or emotionally charged human pursuits like sex) must be correspondingly weak. The Smart Bitches drag those dusty old notions out into the yard for a good beating in the fresh air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They point out that, unlike any other genre, romance novels alone focus on female sexuality as pivotal, not only to the plot, but to the heroine as a fully realized human being. They give us a view of romance not as the unloved step-child of publishing, but as the subversive renegade, daring to openly embrace what everyone privately knows but refuses to admit in polite company. And ain't that just the best thing ever? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -And finally, a quibble NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If I had one quibble with this book (and I did) it was the lack of editorial oversight with regard to the use of there's vs. there're. Yes, I know it's common vernacular now to default to there's in all situations. I also know that language is fluid, that it changes as society changes. But damn it all, common or not, it's still incorrect, and what I can forgive in conversation I cannot in print. Not yet, anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You kids, get out of my yard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There you have it. I thoroughly enjoyed the Smart Bitches and their guide to romance novels; part academic treatise, part adolescent snicker-fest, both sides of my brain reached the last page highly satisfied. ||||| Enlarge By Eileen Blass, USA TODAY Amish romances are set among serene farms and tranquil scenery, much like this rural road in Lancaster County, Pa. EXCERPT EXCERPT Hearing Dat and Adam called a cheerful \"Willkumm\" to Yonnie outside, she assumed he'd come to borrow a tool. She shook off the image of handsome Yonnie sitting in his buggy, nonchalantly holding the reins. True, she'd enjoyed his company quite a lot before Henry Stahl had started seeing her regularly. But that was back last year, when Yonnie and his family had first arrived from Indiana, and Yonnie had only asked to go walking after Singing a few times. From The Missing by Beverly Lewis SPIRITUAL SISTERS SPIRITUAL SISTERS The Amish aren't the only religious group finding their way into romance novels: The Shakers. In The Seeker by Ann Gabhart (Revell, $14.99), a young Kentucky woman follows her ex-fiance to a Shaker community in 1860. Mormons. The Sister Wife by Diane Noble (Avon Inspired, $12.99), set in the turbulent 1840s, centers on a young Mormon convert who must share her beloved husband with another woman. Baptists. In Holy Rollers by ReShonda Tate Billingsley (Gallery, $15), three African-American Houston women -- lifelong pals who have spent their 20s dating pro athletes -- attend a conference for Baptist ministers looking for soul mates. It's plain and simple: The Amish inspirational is one of the fastest-growing genres in romance publishing. For many readers today, it's all about the bonnet. In our sex-soaked society, nothing seems to inflame the imagination quite like the chaste. In popular series such as Beverly Lewis' Seasons of Grace, Wanda Brunstetter's Indiana Cousins and Cindy Woodsmall's Sisters of the Quilt,the Amish fall in love while grappling with religious taboos and forbidden temptations. And it all happens in über-quaint settings brimming with hand-sewn quilts, horse-drawn buggies and made-from-scratch Pennsylvania Dutch specialties such as shoofly pie. \"It's a huge, huge, huge trend,\" says romance blogger Sarah Wendell, co-author of Beyond Heaving Bosoms: The Smart Bitches' Guide to Romance Novels. Who are the Amish? In a 21st-century world, the strictest among them live a 19th-century lifestyle. They are a religious, Christian-based farming community that shuns most modern conveniences such as phones and TVs, and they travel by horse and buggy. They marry among their own faith; the women wear bonnets and modest, drab clothing, the men wear brimmed hats and grow their beards. Children are taught in one-room schoolhouses, and education ends in the eighth grade. Traditional courtship rituals include \"Sunday evening singing\" group gatherings, where boys and girls can meet. Premarital sex is verboten. So what is their appeal to modern readers? Remember when Kelly McGillis' modest Amish beauty enraptured Harrison Ford's homicide detective in the 1985 hit Witness? His tough contemporary cop, who pretended to be Amish to protect the widow Rachel Lapp and her young son, saw a whole new world when he lived amid the closed community of barn-raisers and farmers. With Amish inspirationals, which are shelved under \"religious fiction\" in bookstores like Barnes & Noble, \"readers get to peer inside the Amish community, and it is not like our own community,\" says McDaniel College English professor Pamela Regis, author of A Natural History of the Romance Novel. \"Simplicity is a hallmark of that community, and simplicity is powerful.\" Longing to connect The original creators of the Real Simple life were a group of 16th-century European Protestants who embraced the biblical injunction to turn away from the world. Their descendants are often called \"The Plain People.\" The largest Amish communities in the USA are in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio. While more liberal Amish and Mennonite groups allow members to drive, the Amish inspirational novels focus on the strictest of the strict — the no-car, no-electricity crowd. And that low-tech lifestyle creates a small-town atmosphere, which has deep appeal for readers who may find Wi-Fi-only connections emotionally isolating. \"Even within your own neighborhood, you feel alone,\" says Jane Little of the influential romance blog Dear Author. In an Amish inspirational, \"we're all one big family,\" she says. Professor Regis points out that since the 19th century, American women have devoured sentimental novels celebrating faith and family, hearth and home. But unlike, say, Little House on the Prairie, fans don't need to time- travel to see the Amish. They only need visit tourist-friendly Lancaster, Pa., to witness the Amish in action, which adds to the genre's allure. \"Here you have this agrarian society that is closed to outsiders right in the middle of the Northeast,\" says Wendell. \"It's both historical and contemporary.\" And popular: On Sept. 7, Beverly Lewis, queen of the genre, will launch a series called The Rose Trilogy with The Thorn (Bethany House, $14.99). Set in Lancaster, the series follows two very different sisters. An impulsive marriage to the non-Amish Brandon has thrust Hen into the modern world, from whose alien, materialist values she wants to shield her young daughter. Meanwhile, dutiful Rose is torn between two suitors. More titles on the way Also hitting stores: •Cindy Woodsmall's The Bridge of Peace (WaterBrook, $13.99, Aug. 31). Book 2 in Woodsmall's Ada's House series focuses on dedicated Amish schoolteacher Lena Kauffman as she struggles to help a rebellious male student. Meanwhile, an Amish husband named Grey Graber tries to mend a marriage grown cold. •Wanda Brunstetter's Lydia's Charm (Barbour, $14.99, Sept. 1). After the death of her husband, an Amish woman moves to Charm, Ohio, to help her mother care for her grandfather. Gifts from a mysterious admirer begin to arrive on her porch. •Shelley Shepard Gray's Autumn's Promise (Avon Inspired, $12.99, in stores). A 24-year-old Amish man and a 19-year-old \"English\" (what the Amish call the non-Amish) woman with a past fall in love. Harlequin has three Love Inspired Amish titles coming: Two from Patricia Davids —The Doctor's Blessing (a non-Amish M.D. and Amish nurse-midwife clash) and An Amish Christmas— plus Courting Ruth by Emma Miller. For many readers, the novels' appeal is what they don't include — things like graphic violence and profanity. \"A lot of people say I just want to get away to a place where it's quiet, where people are thoughtful and respect each other, where they go to bed when the sun goes down,\" says Steve Oates, vice president of marketing at Bethany House, which publishes Lewis. Another thing Amish inspirationals lack: sexual content. Even the Marquis de Sade might blush at some of today's more frisky romance covers, but combine romance and Amish? Forget \"bonnet rippers\" with bearded love studs and rocking buggies — a shy girl in a white cloth cap is the traditional inspirational jacket fare. For Beverly Lewis, pushing the envelope means writing about an unmarried Amish woman letting her hair down in front of a man. But with 12 million of her Amish novels in print, she hardly lacks for fans. \"Discretion can be pretty powerful,\" says the Colorado writer. Lewis started the craze for all things Amish in 1997 when she published The Shunning. The novel was inspired by the true story of Lewis' grandmother, who broke with her strict Old Order Mennonite family to marry a Bible College student. (The Amish are an offshoot of the Mennonites.) To date, The Shunning (the title refers to the ostracizing of Amish who rebel against the sect's strictures) has sold more than 1 million copies. Lewis has written more than 80 books, including 23 Amish novels. Her most recent Amish novel, The Telling, made its debut in April at No. 33 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list. The daughter of an Assembly of God minister, Lewis grew up in Lancaster. Although not Amish, Lewis says that because of her extended family, \"I have deep roots in the Plain community.\" (Almost none of the authors writing these books are Amish.) Lewis says \"readers tell me my books make them feel less stressed. It's a slower-paced world ... where people know how to talk to each other.\" Even more exotic to most secular Americans are the values the Amish cherish: humility, obedience and pacifism. (The Amish are conscientious objectors.) \"It's about submission to God, the church, the bishop, your father, your family, then to each other in a community setting,\" says Lewis. And if you are a woman, \"it means surrendering your will to your older brother and to your husband if you marry.\" \"They take their Scripture straight up,\" says Lewis, pointing out how in 2006 the Amish astonished the world by forgiving the gunman who shot and killed five little girls at a one-room schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pa., then reached out to the killer's widow and family. Outsider view With their spiritual focus and emphasis on turning away from the secular world, Amish inspirationals are enormously popular with evangelical Christian readers. \"These books affirm the importance of living a Godly life,\" says Dear Author's Little. Little is not a fan of the books, believing that they inaccurately romanticize Amish culture. She's not alone. In Ohio, some Amish leaders have banned members from reading the books. Out of respect for the Amish, Lewis' novels are not sold on amishbooks.org, says general manager David Bercot. While Bercot is not Amish, he has friends who are. \"They feel her novels do not present a realistic portrayal of the Amish way of life and way of thinking,\" he says. The problem isn't the idea of Amish romance — his website sells Linda Byler's Amish romance novels, for instance. Rather, it's Lewis' \"English,\" or outsider, perspective, that's an issue. But whether Amish communities like it or not, \"it's a genre that is here to stay,\" says Bethany's Oates. And now mystery writers are boarding the best-seller buggy. Hitting stores Sept. 28 is P.L. Gaus' Blood of the Prodigal the first in a six-book Amish-Country Mysteries series being reissued by Plume. In December, look for Marta Perry's Murder in Plain Sight.

{"context": "Border collies were used in the canine IQ tests Scientists are measuring the IQ of dogs in the hope of boosting understanding of the link between health and intelligence; proving that canines really are man's best friend NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from the London School of Economics (LSE) and University of Edinburgh said they used a \"purpose-built barn\" to measure navigation ability, speed and skills in following a pointed arm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the tests on a group of 68 border collies involved the dogs—who were all from farms in Wales—finding their way to a food reward they could see but was behind a barrier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another involved offering two plates of food and measuring how quickly the dogs would go to the one with the bigger portion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They said that because \"confounding\" factors such as drinking, smoking and different socio-economic backgrounds did not apply, it was easier to measure differences in intelligence and links between longevity and intelligence than with humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dogs also develop dementia in similar ways to their human masters, the researchers said in a research paper published in Intelligence, meaning that the findings could be comparable to human beings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even within one breed of dog... there is a variability in test scores.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research, published in the journal Intelligence, looked at whether dog intelligence is structured in a similar way as in humans. When IQ, or 'general intelligence', is tested in people, individuals tend to perform comparably across different types of cognitive tasks – those who do well in one type of task, tend to do well in others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers created a proto-type dog ‘IQ test' which they used to assess the intelligence of 68 working border collies. These tests included: navigation, tested by timing how long it took the dogs to get food that was behind different types of barriers; assessing whether they could tell the difference between quantities of food and; their ability to follow a human pointing gesture to an object. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that dogs that did well on one test tended be better at the other tests. Furthermore, dogs that did tests faster were likely to do them more accurately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Rosalind Arden, a Research Associate at LSE, said: “Just as people vary in their problem solving abilities, so do dogs, even within one breed. This is significant because in humans there is a small but measureable tendency for people who are brighter to be healthier and live longer. So if, as our research suggests, dog intelligence is structured similarly to ours, studying a species that doesn’t smoke, drink, use recreational drugs and does not have large differences in education and income, may help us understand this link between intelligence and health better. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In addition, dogs are one of the few animals that reproduce many of the key features of dementia, so understanding their cognitive abilities could be valuable in helping us to understand the causes this disorder in humans and possibly test treatments for it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suite of tests was conducted in under an hour per dog, which is comparable with the time it takes a person to do an IQ-type test. Previous research on canine cognitive abilities has taken much longer to administer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Mark Adams, Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This is only a first step, but we are aiming to create a dog IQ test that is reliable, valid and can be administered quickly. Such a test could rapidly improve our understanding of the connection between dog intelligence, health, even lifespan, and be the foundation of ‘dognitive epidemiology’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Dogs are excellent for this kind of work because they are willing to participate and seem to enjoy taking part.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In order to get a large sample of dogs from similar backgrounds the researchers recruited working border collies, which meant that there weren’t big differences in how they were raised. The dogs were tested at Kinloch Sheepdogs.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German Chancellor Angela Merkel is shown attending the weekly cabinet meeting of the German government at the chancellery in Berlin, Wednesday, March 15, 2017. President Donald Trump, who will welcome... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — If President Donald Trump wanted a close working relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he had a funny way of showing it during his presidential campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who will welcome Merkel to the White House on Friday, spent much of 2016 bashing the chancellor, accusing her of \"ruining\" Germany for allowing an influx of refugees from Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You watch what happens to Angela Merkel, who I always thought of as a very good leader until she did this. I don't know what went wrong with her,\" said then-candidate Trump at an August rally in Virginia. \"What went wrong? Angela, what happened?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump may not ask the same question directly to Merkel as the leaders of the Western world's most influential countries meet face-to-face for the first time. A snowstorm forced them to postpone their plans for a meeting on Tuesday. The itinerary includes discussions on strengthening NATO, fighting the Islamic State group and resolving Ukraine's conflict, all matters that require close cooperation between the U.S. and Germany, the White House said ahead of the visit. The meeting will be capped with a joint news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond the issues, the sit-down could be a restart of a relationship complicated by Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, Trump seemed to care little about the potentially awkward ramifications were he to win. He invoked Merkel as a foil at his rallies, accusing his campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, of wanting to be \"America's Angela Merkel.\" He lashed out at Time magazine when it named Merkel \"Person of the Year\" in 2015 instead of him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Trump found ways to voice his respect. When a television station in September asked him to name a world leader he admired, he cited Merkel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his meetings with world leaders since the inauguration, Trump has adopted a more diplomatic public persona. He recently spent a weekend bonding with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, golfing and dining with Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He has cultivated a closer friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he has known for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Merkel is used to an altogether different type of American leader, having shared a strong bond with President Barack Obama. She was the last of Obama's key European allies still in power when he left office. And as the leader of Europe's biggest economy and most stable government, Merkel emerged in recent years as the leading voice for a continent struggling with slow growth, identity issues and increased security threats after a string of terrorist attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reflecting their connection, Obama and his wife called Merkel and her husband on the day before Trump's inauguration to thank her for \"her strong, courageous and steady leadership.\" It was Obama's final call with a foreign leader, his advisers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel's first major encounter with Trump comes as she seeks a fourth term as chancellor in elections later this year. She has acknowledged the contest could be difficult and has stressed a need for stability after Britain's decision to leave the European Union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She reportedly has studied Trump's speeches and policies in advance of her trip, eager to find areas for cooperation. Steven Keil, a fellow with The German Marshall Fund of the United States, said Merkel has little reason to dwell on Trump's past comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Merkel is extremely pragmatic in her approach here, but she's also going to have some situations in which it will be tough for her to give too much,\" Keil said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has rattled European leaders with his \"America first\" mantra. He also backed Brexit and is skeptical of multilateral trade agreements. Merkel is expected to reiterate her belief that a strong EU remains in America's strategic and economic interests, a message she shared last month in Munich with Vice President Mike Pence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also is expected to bring with her a trade delegation that includes top executives of BMW and Siemens, employers of tens of thousands of Americans. Many live in Southern states that Trump won in the U.S. election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Military matters may be testy. Trump declared NATO \"obsolete\" before telling European leaders the alliance remains important. But he is expected to reiterate calls for NATO members to meet a minimum commitment for defense spending. Only the U.S. and four other members currently reach the benchmark of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. Germany lags significantly behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not a meeting to go through the list,\" said Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. \"It's actually a really important meeting to set up the tone for the relationship in itself.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conley said for all the lingering issues, Trump and Merkel's encounter held the promise of creating \"a modus vivendi for these two leaders to really create a more stable framework for this critical relationship.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR __ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Twitter follow Ken Thomas at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC and https://twitter.com/colvinj ||||| German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, speaks with French President Francois Hollande at an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, March 10, 2017. EU leaders are debating the future of their bloc as Britain eyes the exit door and far-right parties look to get strong results in upcoming elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —What does President Trump really think about the US relationship with Europe? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s hard to say, given the president’s all-over-the-map comments about the transatlantic partnership and the European Union – comments that have ranged from dismissal and doubts about their usefulness to rock-solid support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some clues should be forthcoming on Friday when German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Western Europe’s longest-serving leader and unquestionably its strongest, visits the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And although there will be important issues on the two leaders’ agenda – continuation of Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, burden-sharing in NATO defense spending, US-EU trade, and in particular Germany’s perennial trade surplus with the US – the meeting is more likely to be a get-to-know-you session where the two very different leaders start to figure out the way forward in a key relationship, analysts of US-Europe relations say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is not a meeting to go through the list. It’s actually a really important meeting to set up the tone for the relationship in itself,” says Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington. Instead of sticking to an agenda, she says, Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel need to use this first face-to-face meeting to set in motion a “modus vivendi for these two leaders to create a more stable framework for this critical relationship.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The German leader seemed to acknowledge this purpose of her trip when she said last week that “talking together rather than talking about one another – that will be my motto of the visit.” Merkel had been scheduled to meet with Trump Tuesday, but a significant late winter storm in Washington prompted the president to call and suggest a slight postponement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel is accustomed to dealing with presidents cut from very different cloths. She developed a solid working relationship with George W. Bush despite some sharp differences, notably on US Iraq policy. And she adjusted to Barack Obama’s cool demeanor and pragmatic approach to US-Europe relations – even though they, too, had their differences, for example on economic policy in response to the 2008 economic crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Trump presents a very different challenge to Merkel and to European leaders generally. No American president in the postwar era has publicly suggested the obsolescence of NATO or cheered on the disintegration of the EU, as a pro-Brexit Trump did on several occasions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Concerns over nationalist populism NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps most disconcerting for Merkel and many Germans generally is the new US president’s inward-focused nationalist populism that they see as a betrayal of the Western values-based system the US has led since World War II. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed Merkel was apparently so distressed by this radical shift in the US worldview that she took the unusual step of alluding to her concerns in her congratulatory letter to then President-elect Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Germany and America are bound by common values – democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views,” Merkel wrote. “It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countries’ governments.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Translation, according to German officials, including Merkel’s vice-chancellor: We want cooperation, but don’t expect Germany to go along with any retreat from the core Western values our countries have long championed together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since taking office, Trump has sounded much more supportive of a strong NATO, even as he has continued to press Alliance partners to demonstrate their commitment to NATO upping defense spending and sharing costs more equitably. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mixed messages on EU NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his sentiments toward the EU and European integration are less clear. In February Trump dispatched Mike Pence to Europe, where the vice president told EU leaders in Brussels that the purpose of his trip was to demonstrate “the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, however, Trump has not hidden his preference for working with countries bilaterally, and it is not clear he has modified his campaign stance that large transnational political organizations – whether it’s the EU, the United Nations, or the World Trade Organization – are the enemies of national sovereignty and of a nation’s people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hostility to international organizations could start to take form as policy Thursday when the White House is expected to release its top line budget proposal – with up to a one-third reduction in State Department and foreign aid spending. Trump has reportedly instructed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to slash US funding of the United Nations and its related agencies and activities by up to 50 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the White House in late January, Trump enthused about a “fantastic” Brexit and praised Britain for deciding to be “free and independent” of the EU. Reports have seeped out of the White House that Trump is considering a harsh critic of the traditional strong US support for the EU to be Washington’s EU ambassador in Brussels – as have reports that Trump political strategist Steve Bannon continues to recommend that the president double down on a nationalist and anti-integration stance with European leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The affinity of the president and some in his inner circle for nationalist and populist movements in Europe raises concern among Germans that the US could support the unraveling of Europe, which would have enormous consequences for Germany,” says Jeffrey Rathke, deputy director of CSIS’s Europe Program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During a recent visit to Berlin, Mr. Rathke says he was also struck by deep concerns there over “allegations from the president and some of his economic advisors that Germany uses the European Union and the euro currency to the detriment of the US economy.” Clearly Merkel, he adds, will underscore the more traditional view that strong bilateral and US-EU economic ties are good for both sides of the Atlantic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel's balancing act NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One advantage Trump may have in this first meeting is that while he is just starting his term as president after a surprise win, Merkel faces a very tough reelection campaign back home, with voting set for September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Trump extremely unpopular in Germany, Merkel is left to walk a tightrope between maintaining her posture as the values-driven anti-Trump and demonstrating that she can preserve the transatlantic partnership, says Jeffrey Brown, a transatlantic policy specialist at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At the White House, Merkel will not only have to prove that she can toe a tough line on Trump, but also that she can effectively position herself as the arbiter of a trans-Atlantic relationship that could very well become increasingly strained in the years ahead,” Mr. Brown writes in a recent post on the Bertelsmann website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With 11 years of experience dealing with a wide variety of European leaders and with two different US presidents, Merkel is likely to approach Trump with the same pragmatism backed by firm convictions that have made her Europe’s preeminent leader, says CSIS’s Ms. Conley.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She does not do this in an arrogant way … wagging a finger if you will,” she adds. Rather, Merkel will be “reaffirming that’s the basis on which this relationship has continued and [that] any movement away from that will reduce the relationship by definition.” ||||| It would seem that when it comes to the transatlantic relationship and US presidents, Chancellor Merkel - who is currently campaigning for a fourth term in office - has seen it all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She hosted the deeply unpopular George W. Bush at a wild boar barbecue in her home state on the Baltic Sea coast and the wildly popular Barack Obama for a sausage and beer breakfast in the Bavarian Alps without ever becoming really chummy with either of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Opinion: Water off a duck's back NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Things Trump said about Merkel - and vice versa NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - The end of a beautiful friendship? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the tenure of both presidents, she weathered major shocks to the transatlantic system, like the aftermath of the Iraq War and the NSA affair, but despite those strains managed to establish such solid ties with the jovial Bush and the cerebral Obama that both eventually considered her the go-to person on most matters European. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Complicated challenge NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with Donald Trump now residing in the White House, Merkel faces her biggest transatlantic challenge so far. And it comes at a time when she is under increasing pressure at home, facing a resurgent rival Social Democrats in national elections that are a mere six months away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Regarding American politics it has never been as complicated as it is now,\" said Josef Janning, who heads the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel will have to take a new tack to try to establish a decent working relationship with the president, said John Harper, a US foreign policy professor at Johns Hopkins University in Bologna, since Trump is a \"completely differently animal\" than Obama or Bush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chancellor Merkel invited President Obama to a traditional Bavarian breakfast in 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is because, unlike his predecessors - and Merkel - Trump had no previous governmental experience before becoming president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Add to that that Trump's presidential demeanor - such as his tendency to expound quickly and aggressively on a myriad of topics, political or not, often via Twitter, or his ongoing and rather personal battle with the media - make him an outlier among recent White House occupant. He's also the polar opposite to Merkel's political style, which is routinely described as calm and collected - critics even call her bland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposing worldviews NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While their different backgrounds and governing styles are important, these pale in comparison to the pair's vastly divergent political worldviews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The German chancellor favors a cooperative and multilateral approach to global politics. While Trump - from what one can deduce so far - appears to favor a great power approach to international affairs, to disdain multilateral institutions and structures and to view politics essentially as a zero-sum game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That makes finding common ground between Merkel and Trump difficult and sets the bar of what to expect from their first meeting rather low, especially given the prior verbal tiffs between them and their different domestic audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's why neither Janning nor Harper expected any tangible results from this first get-together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low expectations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One of her interests is to get at least a good enough verbal commitment of the new president to the G20 process and to the idea of addressing issues through cooperative structures,\" said Janning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chancellor Merkel hosted President George W. Bush in 2008 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Preparation for the G20 summit, which Merkel will host in Hamburg this summer, serves as the ostensible reason behind her White House visit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another key topic that is bound to be broached by the pair is the future of the EU. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who has been an ardent supporter of Britain's exit from the union, has repeatedly made clear that he thinks little of the EU and prefers bilateral relationships with European countries over going via Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given Trump's known animus towards the EU, Merkel is expected to make clear why the union is not just important for Germany and Europe, but also for the US. That could be a difficult task, noted Janning, since Trump, unlike his predecessors, has suggested that he does not view the US as responsible for European defense or as the unchallenged leader of the transatlantic alliance. Trump's stance toward Europe was on display when he received Brexit architect Nigel Farage as one of his first foreign visitors after winning the election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No more insults NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's why Harper would already regard a changed tone toward Europe as success: \"What I hope would come from that visit is that she can at least persuade Trump to stop attacking the European Union and to stop encouraging politicians like Marine Le Pen.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similarly on relations with Russia, another contentious issue, Merkel will likely explain to Trump that she considers a firm stance on the shared principles and rules of the European postwar order the basis for engaging Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether Merkel and Trump can find some common ground to work together will not be evident after this first meeting. But it will become more clear within the next half-year: a crucial time for Merkel, who faces re-election, and for Trump, who has to produce results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, said Harper, their first meeting will likely have at least one immediate effect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Once Trump meets Merkel, I think it will be harder for him to insult her.\" ||||| BERLIN — “We need each other.” That, in a nutshell, will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s not-so-subtle message to U.S. President Donald Trump when the two meet in the White House Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forget all the talk about a showdown in the Oval Office. Merkel, whatever her personal views of Trump, isn’t going to Washington to confront him. She’s there to win him over. “It’s important to develop a mutual understanding, to build a foundation,” a senior German official said before Merkel departed Berlin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That may sound like a tall order, considering the harsh words Trump has lobbed in Merkel’s direction. Last year, he accused her of “going off the reservation” during the refugee crisis and characterized her policies as a “total disgrace.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if ever there were a politician capable of putting aside personal feelings in pursuit of her country’s strategic interests, it’s the German chancellor. One needn’t look further than the events of the past week. After Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused German officials of Nazi tactics for barring Turkish politicians from holding rallies in the country, Merkel’s response was that she was “saddened.” Erdoğan followed up Monday evening, claiming Merkel “supports terrorists.” Her spokesman said she wouldn’t dignify the accusation with a response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the years, Merkel has deployed a similar strategy of de-escalation with other authoritarian regimes and would-be strongmen, from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who once tried to unnerve her with his dog, to former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, even if Merkel is accustomed to dealing with aggressive and uncouth men, she has never had as much riding on a bilateral meeting as she will on Friday. The two leaders were not initially expected to meet until Trump travels to Europe later this year, but amid growing transatlantic tension, Merkel pushed for an earlier meeting in Washington and the president invited her. Her aides say she’s been preparing for weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is difficult to overstate the importance of the U.S. relationship to Berlin. When it comes to the existential questions of the economy and security, the U.S. remains Germany’s indispensable partner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Germany’s economy depends on exports. As a buyer of German goods, the U.S. is unsurpassed. Ahead of France, the U.K. and China, it spends more than twice as much on “made in Germany” as Japan, Russia and Mexico combined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For decades, Germany (with Washington’s blessing) has essentially outsourced its defense to the U.S. Almost 30 years after the end of the Cold War, America has more troops stationed in Germany — about 35,000 — than in any other foreign country in the Western Hemisphere. Under the protection of the U.S. nuclear shield, Germany embraced European integration and its economy has flourished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What’s less obvious is what the U.S. gets out of the deal. Merkel’s challenge during several hours of both one-on-one and group meetings with Trump will be to convince him that the answer is “plenty.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To that end, Merkel will focus on a subject dear to Trump’s heart: trade. Faced with accusations that Germany, which sells much more to the U.S. than it buys, is taking advantage of its ally, Merkel is bringing along the CEOs of BMW, Siemens and auto-parts-giant Schaeffler to the White House to present the president with a different story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The business leaders are expected to wax about the hundreds of billions German industry has invested in U.S.-based production and the nearly 700,000 Americans German companies employ, according to people briefed on the preparations. They also plan to discuss their country’s vaunted apprenticeship system, which firms use to groom skilled workers, and propose to invest more in such programs in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel’s challenge will be to counter Trump’s perception of reality without turning him against her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given that Trump has focused considerable attention during the first weeks of his presidency advertising corporate investment in America, Merkel’s strategy could help get Germany off his blacklist of unfair trading partners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A meeting of the minds on Merkel’s other big priority — European security — is likely to be more challenging. Merkel is keen to extract strong expressions of support for the NATO alliance and continued solidarity in countering the Russian threat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. positions on Russian sanctions and the crisis in the Ukraine haven’t changed under Trump so far, but the signals coming from the president and his advisers have been confusing. Trump, for example, has suggested he’d pursue a more conciliatory approach toward Moscow — “Wouldn’t it be nice if we got along with Russia,” he likes to ask. But most of his key advisers, including Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, appear to embrace a harder line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some European officials see Trump’s overtures toward Moscow and his complaints about NATO as a tactic aimed at scaring Europe into spending more on defense. If so, it’s already worked in Germany. Merkel has agreed to devote more resources to the military and to work toward reaching NATO’s goal of spending 2 percent of national income on defense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel will emphasize that commitment but it’s far from clear Trump will be impressed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In terms of style, the two couldn’t be more different. Merkel, a star pupil at school, immerses herself in policy details and wields those facts in debates to underpin her arguments. Her exchanges with the equally wonkish Barack Obam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR a appeared at times to be a competition over who had memorized more of the briefing book, aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, however, is what his supporters describe as a “a big picture guy.” Even some of his stalwarts worry that he never makes it to the second page of a memo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel’s challenge will be to counter Trump’s perception of reality without turning him against her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While much is made of her experience in dealing with type-A personalities, it also has to be said that those relationships haven’t been that successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Ukraine crisis, her aides boasted repeatedly that she had spoken with Putin dozens of times. But her interventions had little discernible impact. The Russian leader has made few if any real concessions on either Crimea or eastern Ukraine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Erdoğan’s recent attacks on Merkel may be largely political theater, directed at his domestic audience, but his offensive suggests he doesn’t take her all that seriously, despite her repeated attempts to woo him. If he did, he wouldn’t jeopardize the relationship the way he has in recent days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, in her meeting with Trump, it shouldn’t be that difficult to steer clear of areas of discord. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trade aside, the main issues dividing Trump and Merkel — treatment of refugees, the planned wall on the Mexican border, etc. — are matters of domestic policy. These are unlikely to feature prominently, if at all, in their discussions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Considering his administration’s rough start, Trump, eager to show he can be a statesman, may be as determined as Merkel for their first meeting to go smoothly. Though she has dismissed descriptions of her as the “last defender of the liberal order” as “grotesque” and “absurd,” Merkel is widely viewed as the world’s most influential female leader, one widely respected in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In their first call after Trump’s election win in November, he predicted their partnership would be “tremendous.” Merkel, sensing an opening, appears intent on holding him to it. ||||| David A.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) The red welcome mat is out at the White House. Angela Merkel in coming to town. This ought to be a cause for celebration. In terms of ideology, Merkel is perhaps the most conservative ruler of a major country in the European Union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But look out, this lady is also as close to an Iron Chancellor as any German leader since Bismarck two centuries ago. She's tough, she has three terms under her belt and is headed for a fourth, and she has an agenda she's ready to unfold before her host, Donald Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That agenda may not be in any sense contiguous with the one Trump has embraced, and that's where the friction could happen -- if it does. One can only hope it won't. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's hard to say what's at the top of the agenda since there are so many points of friction before the two even meet: Russia, NATO, trade, climate change, refugees, counterterrorism. So, let's just take them in what should be their order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No Western leader knows Vladimir Putin better than Angela Merkel. While she led Europe in pressing for tough sanctions against Russia for its seizure of Crimea and incursions into Eastern Ukraine, Putin respects her toughness and longevity in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, Merkel speaks to Putin virtually every week by telephone. She has told confidants that she sees it as an essential duty. Putin needs to hear from voices outside his immediate Kremlin circle. And without her regular contacts , he would not -- a potential catastrophe for the West. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If there is anyone who could teach Trump about Putin, it's Merkel. Hopefully, Trump will have the patience and good sense to listen as his course of instruction begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NATO NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel should be pleased that some of Trump's envoys have expressed a commitment to NATO somewhat more accepting than his sentiments during the campaign. Still, he continues to demand that NATO member nations increase to 2% of GDP their defense expenditures. Only four nations — Greece, Estonia, Britain and Poland — managed that level last year. Germany is number 14, with just 1.2% of its GDP. Still, that amounts to €37 billion ($39 billion) and is set to reach €39.2 billion by 2020.

MUST WATCH Pence reassures NATO allies in Munich speech 03:21 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're moving in the right direction, but we can't do it in one year,\" German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with Reuters. But with a $54 billion increase in defense spending in the new Trump budget, and 3.6% of America's GDP already committed to defense — triple Germany's level — this could be a contentious issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump should listen to Merkel's quite sound reasoning that no major nation is an island and that, as her defense minister pointed out, \"The most important thing is reliability.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trade NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These kinds of economics segue neatly into trade. Last year, Germany posted a $65 billion trade surplus with the United States and so far this year has been running ahead of last year. During the campaign, Trump had threatened to impose a 35% tariff on German carmakers who import their products into the United States. But Merkel could also point to the reality that in 2015, German direct investment in the United States hit $255 billion -- a lot of it German automakers' plants in the United States, employing 670,000 American workers producing cars here for American customers.

While Trump has condemned multinational trade and tariff agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Merkel is still hoping to salvage the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership pact. With the European Union considering itself a single tariff unit, it might not be so hard for Merkel to persuade Trump that T-TIP is simply a nice, bilateral trade pact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Climate change NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel has been one of the big backers of the Paris agreement to control greenhouse gases and work toward halting global warming. With the Environmental Protection Administration suffering the biggest cutbacks in the new Trump budget and the President lifting tough fuel economy standards from American automakers, it's hard to see how they could reach any sort of compromise in this meeting. But count on Merkel to make an opening argument in what will likely be a long and contentious issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Refugees and counterterrorism NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If there is one issue that has been the most subject to the kinds of rhetoric calculated to poison relations between world leaders, it's refugees. During his campaign, Trump alternately praised Merkel as \"a really great world leader,\" then promptly snapped that she was \"ruining\" her country by accepting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, who Trump claims conceal hordes of terrorists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He quickly pounced on the Christmas truck attack in Berlin by a Tunisian terrorist, swaggering \"I've been proven to be right.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now with Trump's latest immigration order suspended by a federal judge and Merkel facing her own internal attacks by opponents in her re-election bid, both sides would seem to need some mutual reinforcement, or at least a path toward lowering the rhetorical temperature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking each other's measure NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Above all, Merkel is here to take the measure of the successor to Barack Obama, with whom she had a remarkably chummy relationship. Clearly the stakes are high for this meeting: the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance, German leadership of Europe, a united front against Russian aggression, billions in trade and investment and a common front against terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet it is hardly a meeting of equals. Merkel comes to this session utterly in command, at the very moment the electoral power of European Trump-style populism has been called into question with the sound defeat on Tuesday of the far-right candidate for Prime Minister in the Netherlands. By contrast, Trump is very much under attack on all sides, many of his core priorities still unrealized and still out of grasp. It is this dynamic, more than any other, that threatens a positive outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alternatively, Donald Trump could bask in the reflected popularity of Merkel, learning and profiting from her long years of all but unquestioned power and glory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there are limits. Merkel will not be going to Mar-a-Lago. ||||| The German chancellor’s first visit to Trump’s White House on Friday promises to be awkward – judging by the experience of May, Abe, Trudeau, Netanyahu and Kenny NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What sort of fireworks might erupt when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, meets Donald Trump for the first time at the White House on Friday? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If visits by foreign leaders to the White House so far are any guide, it will be … awkward, and perhaps embarrassing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top Trump diplomacy: we rate the president's calls and calamities with world leaders Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British prime minister, Theresa May, has the distinction of being the first foreign leader to have visited Trump, with Shinzō Abe of Japan, Justin Trudeau of Canada, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Enda Kenny of Ireland following closely at her heels. Each of those trips was uncomfortable in its own unique way, but the visits did share a basic format. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merkel can expect to undergo a meet-and-greet with Trump in the Oval Office, with a photo opportunity; a private bilateral meeting with Trump; and, finally, a joint news conference. (Abe, like Trump an avid golfer, went in for the premium package, spending the whole weekend with the first family at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private Florida resort. Kenny, by contrast, got the basic package, which included a luncheon but not a news conference.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a closer look at what Merkel might be in for, we’ve broken down the previous trips by foreign leaders to the White House round by round. And we’ve declared a winner for each round, based on who handled Trump best. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Round 1: Pleased to meet you NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To greet a peer, the custom in much of the world is to shake hands. Unfortunately, Trump has a highly idiosyncratic handshake that is often visibly uncomfortable for the other person. And it’s not just his handshake. But let’s go to the tapes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: They held hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Walking in the West Wing colonnade alongside May, Trump grabbed her hand and held it for awhile before patting it twice and letting it go. She kept a poker face. An anonymous White House source spread the word afterward that Trump, 70, is afraid of slopes and stairs and that the pair had to walk down a slope, so he reached out for her. But others suggested it just looked like he grabbed her because he could. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: They shook hands for 19 seconds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Posing for photographers in the Oval Office, Trump and Abe locked hands and then seemed incapable of unlocking. The awkwardness escalated when Trump asked Abe what the Japanese photographers were saying. “Look at me,” Abe replied. So then Trump gazed at Abe. When it ended, Abe turned away with a traumatized grimace, gripping his chair and bobbing his hips. Then Trump told Abe he had “strong hands” and pretended to grip a golf club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trudeau NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trudeau beat Trump at his own game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Like some kind of Canadian Superman, Trudeau proved impervious to the handshaking tricks – yanking the arm, patting the hand – that Trump uses to subdue mere mortals. Further asserting his self-possession, Trudeau allowed himself a disdainful glance at Trump’s outstretched hand in the Oval Office before he accepted it. (You don’t leave your largest trading partner wholly hanging.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netanyahu NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: The awkwardest reception. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: When Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu emerged from their limo at the White House, Donald and Melania Trump greeted them with a friendly chat … that seemed like it would never end. There was a lot of fumbling with arms and hands and elbows and shoulders, as if none of the group had ever attempted conversation with more than one other person before. Then they stood for a picture – with the Trumps in the middle, as if they were the guests. Then, after more fumbling, Trump randomly returned a guard’s frozen salute and the foursome disappeared inside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenny NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trump was seemingly the only man in the room not wearing a bright green tie and a shrubbery pocket square in honor of St Patrick’s day. Then it got meta. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Somebody didn’t get the memo about the shrubbery thing, apparently. In Trump’s defense, Kenny’s visit fell a day before the actual holiday. In the Oval Office, Kenny actually cracked a joke about Trump’s handshaking style. “You can see nobody pulled anybody else,” Kenny said. “Yeah, I’ve been getting a little heat for that,” Trump replied, incredulously. Not from us, Mr President. Then Trump said: “I love Ireland. I love it. I really love Ireland.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the award for best handling of Trump goes to … Trudeau. Especially if Ivanka Trump were one of the judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Round 2: The press conference NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The joint news conference can be a delicate pas de deux, in which world leaders standing side by side strive to show mutual deference while speaking to their distinct national audiences. It must be said for Trump that, so far, he is better at these than he is at anything that involves touching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trump patronized May a bit, telling her that Brexit “was going to be a wonderful thing for your country”. May smiled and prayed silently for a trade deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: There was some built-in suspense for this one, for the American audience, because it was Trump’s first official appearance on the global stage as president. Would he observe basic protocol? Would he allow May to speak? Would he mock her British accent? Would he make a dumb 1776 joke? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the end, it went OK. Trump said: “A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.” May said Trump had vowed 100% support for Nato, which for Trump counted as news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But at times, Trump seemed to be talking down to May. “I think the prime minister, first of all, has other things that she’s much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship,” Trump said when May was asked about that issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trump was not equipped with a translation earpiece but seemed to pretend to understand Abe speaking Japanese. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Trump spoke first. Then Abe smiled, took out his translation earpiece and began speaking in his native language. Trump, without inserting his own earpiece, nodded along and appeared to listen intently to Abe’s remarks. A White House spokeswoman later explained that Trump “did see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Did it constitute an international incident? No. Did it reinforce the idea that Trump is in way over his head and desperately bluffing at every turn? That’s not for us to say. Trump did put a small speaker to his right ear during the subsequent question-and-answer session with journalists, some of whom were from Japan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trudeau NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: The Canadian prime minister barely suppressed a smile in the process of extruding diplomatic language on the subject of his counterpart’s wild talk on refugees and immigration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Trump thinks Syrian refugees are secret terrorists, while Trudeau literally hugs them, a Toronto Star journalist pointed out. Would they care to comment? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There have been times when we have differed in our approaches, and that’s always done firmly and respectfully,” Trudeau replied, when suddenly the right side of his face tried to break into a smile of sympathy, discomfort or perhaps disbelief. “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he finished, somberly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump did not smile. While the US’s trade relationship with Canada was generally good, he said, “we’ll be tweakin’ it”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netanyahu NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trump jettisoned longstanding US support for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Netanyahu in general ran circles around Trump, at one point turning Trump’s request for Israel to stop settlement construction into a joke. “He’s a good negotiator,” Trump said, as the crowd laughed. “That’s the art of the deal!” Netanyahu quipped. Good times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Trump gave a vacuous and poorly improvised reply. “I’m looking at two-state, and one-state,” he said. “And I like the one that both parties like. I’m very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two, but honestly, if Bibi and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then Trump said of a US embassy in Jerusalem: “I’d love to see that happen.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenny NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: There wasn’t a news conference, but there was a luncheon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: Trump bravely pronounced “taoiseach” and called Kenny “my new friend”. Then he praised the contributions of Irish immigrants to the United States. He mentioned that John F Kennedy had once been US president. And he said: “I’ve spent a lot of time at St Patrick’s Day parades over the years, I will tell you that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the award for best handling of Trump goes to … Netanyahu. In his first visit, he seemingly had the new American president dropping a two-decade-old commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Round 3: The art of the deal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is the round that happens behind closed doors, in private meetings between the parties. There are no transcripts and, from the US side at least, scant official description of what was discussed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One way to gauge how it went is from the coverage of the leaders’ trips in the media back home. Here’s how some of that coverage looked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: May was criticized for not confronting Trump over refugees and over his travel ban. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: After meeting Trump, May claimed to have laid “the foundations of a trade deal”. But the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused her of failing to defend British citizens affected by the travel ban and failing to stand up for refugees, women and other groups Trump has attacked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May said she “made very clear” that Trump’s travel ban on was “divisive and wrong”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian view on the Trump-May meeting: they are playing with fire | Editorial Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trump gave Abe the deluxe dignitary treatment, golfing with him, sending Melania Trump out into the public eye with Akie Abe, and even troubleshooting an international incident with the Japanese prime minister on the terrace at Mar-a-Lago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: During his campaign, Trump accused Japan of dumping goods on the United States, of manipulating its currency and of not paying a fair share for its defense. But face-to-face with Abe, those criticisms disappeared, to be replaced by praise from Trump for Japan’s “heavy” investment in mutual defense and a commitment to “bringing those ties even closer”, as well as personal compliments from Trump to Abe and his wife – “a wonderful couple!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To cap the trip, the two leaders spent a cozy weekend together at Mar-a-Lago, where a provocative North Korean missile launch “was played out by candlelight against a backdrop of hotel muzak, high-paying guests and low-paid waiters”, the Guardian’s Julian Borger wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abe appears to have harvested a popularity bump from the trip, with a Kyodo News poll finding that 70.2% were satisfied with the Abe-Trump talks, while only 19.5% were dissatisfied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trudeau NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Trudeau was praised for his restraint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: “According to a senior government source, there was some acknowledgment in private of the two leaders’ differing perspectives on immigration,” a CBC columnist wrote afterwards. “But the president is said to think highly of Canada’s points-based system for selecting immigrants.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Cohen called it a “good, successful first date” and praised Trudeau’s “bravura performance”: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However tempted, you say nothing about global warming … At the same time, you do not lecture your host on Muslim refugees, Mexican immigrants, the value of the UN – or, frankly, any of your values. Canada, which can be smug, has done that sort of thing before. It never works well. At the end of the day, you do what you have to do to keep our biggest customer happy. Mr. Trudeau did. It was a bravura performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netanyahu NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Netanyahu’s rapport with Trump was contrasted favorably with the prime minister’s lack of rapport with Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: While Haaretz noted that the Trump-Netanyahu meeting was loaded with “ignorance, internal contradictions, political sloganeering and more than a few disagreements”, most coverage back home of the prime minister’s trip noted the palpable warmth between Netanyahu and Trump, who have known each other since the 1980s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Trump greeted Netanyahu as an old and dear friend, hosting him in Blair House, and lauding him as a smart and good leader,” the Jerusalem Post effused. “The tone was markedly different from the acrimony that always seemed to follow Netanyahu’s meetings with former US president Barack Obama.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenny NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened: Kenny won positive coverage back home for asking Trump to pay special consideration to Irish immigrants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tell me more: The Irish Times reported that Kenny “said he had raised both the issue of legal immigration paths for Irish people, including the revival of a stalled proposal of a new E3 visa scheme, as well as the situation of undocumented Irish citizens living in the United States”: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the president had been surprised at the number of undocumented Irish living in the country - said to be 50,000 - and had expected it to be much higher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian quoted Kenny as telling Trump that undocumented Irish immigrants just want to “make America great”, adding: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that’s what people want. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the award for best handling of Trump goes to … Abe. On his watch, Trump was transformed from hostile critic to praiseful host. Then they went golfing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next up: Merkel"}
{"context": "(05-04) 14:45 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- A young research associate at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center who died over the weekend after becoming infected with the same type of deadly bacteria he had been working with has been identified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is Richard Din, 25, of San Francisco, an official in the medical examiner's office said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Din, who lived on Treasure Island, died Saturday at the hospital where he worked, just 17 hours after coming down with a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, a rare strain of bacteria that can cause blood and meningitis infections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the past six months, he had been working for the Northern California Institute for Research and Education, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing veterans' health research at the VA hospital. He had been handling the bacterium for several weeks before his death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the unlikely chance that Din could have contracted the illness from another source, the cause of his death remains under investigation. Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the bacterium is linked in the United States to the deaths of about 75 people a year, but is a comparatively common cause of infection and death in sub-Saharan Africa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is investigating how the exposure occurred, received a report about the death on Sunday, said Peter Melton, spokesman for the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cal/OSHA investigators will interview Din's co-workers, retrace his steps and learn more about how the material was stored and handled, Melton said. The agency has up to six months to complete its investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official from the VA hospital said Din's co-workers described him as \"fastidious\" and no initial evidence of spills or equipment failure was noted. Din's co-workers and close contacts have been treated with preventive antibiotics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A town hall meeting was held Monday at the VA medical center to inform employees about what happened and to offer grief-counseling services, said Dr. Harry Lampiris, chief of infectious disease at the hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This article appeared on page C - 2 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| State and federal health officials are investigating how a rare and virulent bacteria strain appears to have killed a young researcher at a VA hospital's infectious diseases lab in San Francisco, setting off alarms that the man's friends and fellow researchers may have also been exposed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 25-year-old laboratory researcher at San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center died Saturday morning shortly after asking friends to take him to the hospital. For the week and months before his death, he had been handling a bacteria linked to deadly bloodstream infections at the VA hospital's Northern California Institute for Research and Education, said Peter Melton, a spokesman for the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man, whose name has not been released, was working with fellow researchers to develop a vaccine for a bacterial strain that causes septicemia and meningitis. Hours after he left work, however, the germ that he was studying took his own life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He left the lab around 5 p.m.\" Friday, said Harry Lampiris, chief of the VA hospital's infectious diseases division. \"He had no symptoms at all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two hours later, however, the Treasure Island resident reported to his girlfriend he was feeling sick with a headache, fever and chills, Lampiris said. Not until Saturday morning did the symptoms grow worse with a body rash. He asked friends to take him to the hospital but fell unconscious in the car and had no NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR pulse by the time he arrived. He died later in the morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It starts out so nonspecifically people don't think it's anything serious,\" Lampiris said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Obviously, he didn't suspect it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The San Francisco Department of Public Health is trying to identify everyone who had close contact with the worker during the time he was infected, said city health spokeswoman Eileen Shields. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His friends and co-workers are getting preventive antibiotics, as are some 60 health workers who treated him at the hospital, Shields said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bacteria spreads through respiratory exposure such as sneezing and coughing or kissing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cal-OSHA confirmed Wednesday that it is investigating the lab worker's death and whether the lab where he worked followed safety protocols. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also is helping state and city authorities determine what occurred, a spokeswoman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're not certain how this death happened, but hopefully the investigation will turn up some answers to help prevent it from ever happening again,\" CDC spokeswoman Alison Patti wrote in an email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A state laboratory has confirmed that the San Francisco worker was infected with the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium, the same germ he had been handling at the laboratory for weeks and months before his death. It also confirmed that the rare strain he and fellow researchers were studying -- Serogroup B -- was the same one found in his body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The germ can cause two separate but equally deadly conditions. One is septicemia, a bloodstream inflammation that causes bleeding into the skin and organs and is believed to be the cause of the man's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other is meningitis, which inflames the thin layer of tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord and can lead to hearing loss, brain damage and death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not immediately clear to researchers if he was afflicted by both conditions or just the septicemia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers at the San Francisco facility had been studying the B strain for years because it is the only one of five major strains causing meningitis and septicemia for which no vaccine is available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Situated on a coastal bluff in northwest San Francisco, the VA hospital partners with UC San Francisco for scientific and clinical research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nonprofit institute where the researcher worked gets about $47 million annually in federal grants and contracts to combat disease, according to a public financial statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researcher who died was a biology major who had joined the laboratory in October as an associate. Colleagues described him as a smart and conscientious researcher who took safety precautions, Lampiris said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease, or meningitis, are reported in the United States each year, Patti said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it is rare for a research lab worker to be infected by the deadly germs he is studying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is an organism that merits rigorous safety precautions in a research laboratory,\" Patti said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lampiris said workers at the San Francisco facility are expected to wear gloves, gowns and do their work behind a protective \"safety cabinet,\" or hood, while isolating the bacteria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"His co-workers felt he was highly competent and that he was adequately supervised to do the level of work,\" Lampiris said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sixteen laboratory workers worldwide contracted meningitis between 1985 and 2001, including six in the United States, according to a 2005 study by the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Half died. Most did not have sufficient respiratory protection, the study said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Signs of the disease include a stiff neck, fever, nausea and other flu-like symptoms, but the incubation period can be as short as three days."}

We don’t think of the Kindle Fire as a tablet. We think of it as a service.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most other tablet devices, including the iPad and BlackBerry PlayBook, bear price tags twice that of the Kindle Fire. However, given the lack of a camera, microphone and 3G connectivity, perhaps it's better to think of it as a competitor to Barnes & Nobles's $249.99 Nook Color. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shares of Barnes & Noble were down approximately 9% during the announcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For further details, catch our live blog from the Amazon event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kindle Fire NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TV Commercial for Kindle Fire NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Mashable's Complete Amazon Kindle & Kindle Fire Coverage ||||| Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the world’s largest online retailer, unveiled its Kindle Fire tablet computer, taking aim at Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s bestselling iPad with a device that’s smaller and less than half the price. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kindle Fire will have a 7-inch display and sell for $199, compared with $499 for Apple’s cheapest iPad, Amazon executives said in interviews with Bloomberg Businessweek. The device, a souped-up version of the Kindle electronic-book reader, will run on Google Inc.’s Android software, the Seattle-based company said. Amazon also introduced a touch-screen version of its e-reader, to be called Kindle Touch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is betting he can harness Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce to pose a real challenge to Apple’s iPad, after tablets from rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Research In Motion Ltd. have fallen short. Sales of Amazon’s electronic books, movies and music on the device may help make up for the narrower profit margins that are likely to result from the low price, said Brian Blair, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Amazon is really the only other guy, the only other potential tablet player, that has a similar offering to what Apple has,” Blair said in an interview last week. “If you look across their product offerings, they have content that none of the other tablet makers currently have because they have content on the media side.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IPad Appeal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the Kindle Fire can vie with the iPad in access to media content, it lacks a camera, microphone or a connection to a 3G wireless network. It may not appeal to consumers who are drawn to the iPad’s larger screen and willing to pay a premium for added features such as video chat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Amazon tablet is not necessarily a direct competitor to the iPad,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco, in a telephone interview. Another version of the Kindle may debut next year with more features to directly compete with Apple, he said. Right now, “the price point is the headline rather than the functionality.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starting today, customers can order the new tablet, as well as a basic version of the Kindle e-reader for $79 and two new touch-screen readers, one for $99 and another for $149 that has 3G wireless access. The lowest-priced Kindle can ship today, the tablet will go out Nov. 15, and touch-screen readers will be released Nov. 21, Amazon said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shares Rise NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon’s shares rose $5.50, or 2.5 percent, to $229.71 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has increased 28 percent this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple fell $2.25 to $397.01. Shares of Barnes & Noble Inc., maker of the Nook e-reader, declined 91 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $12.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kindle Fire offers Wi-Fi connectivity and comes with a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime, the company’s $79-a-year membership service that includes streaming video and free two- day shipping. A web browser called Amazon Silk will use so- called cloud computing to speed access to content over the Internet. The tablet will be available on Amazon’s website and at retailers that already sell the Kindle e-readers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon has painted over the rough surfaces of Google’s Android operating system with a fresh and easy-to-use interface and tied the device closely to its own large and growing content library of movies, magazines and music. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Forrester Research Inc. predicts the tablet market will grow 51 percent a year through 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sales Potential NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the new Kindle will add to Amazon’s sales, estimated by analysts to rise 32 percent to $64.6 billion in 2012, the company may disappoint if the tablet doesn’t bring in revenue quickly, Steve Weinstein, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Oregon, said in a note this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consumer reaction to the device will play a “critical” role in the company’s growth, he said. Analysts on average predict Amazon’s gross margin, a measure of profitability, will fall to 22.17 percent in 2012 from 22.35 percent last year, according to a Bloomberg survey. Gross margin is the percentage of sales left after subtracting production costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Without success in tablets, investor growth expectations for 2012 could prove too aggressive,” Weinstein said Sept. 26. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple started selling the original iPad in April 2010, and introduced the iPad 2 in March of this year. The touch-screen device, which has a 9.7-inch diagonal display, is already Apple’s biggest source of revenue after the iPhone. The company shipped 9.25 million iPads in the quarter that ended June 25. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mobile Applications NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple also leads the market for mobile applications, with more than 425,000. Over 100,000 of those apps are custom- designed for the iPad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two other tablets have failed to make a dent in Apple’s dominance so far. Research In Motion Ltd.’s PlayBook, introduced in the second quarter, shipped 200,000 units, less than half of what analysts predicted. Analysts had already cut estimates for full-year PlayBook shipments to an average of 2.2 million, according to a Bloomberg survey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hewlett-Packard Co., meanwhile, discontinued its TouchPad in August -- only about a month after its debut. And Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world’s largest software maker, may not have its Windows operating system for tablets ready until next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The iPad accounted for 68 percent of all tablets shipped worldwide in the second quarter, according to Framingham, Massachusetts-based research firm IDC. Other Android-based tablets, including models from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., accounted for 27 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Amazon has the clout and the content to take on Apple, the company will have to go beyond the tablet released today to be a serious competitor, Blair said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t actually believe 7-inch is going to be a viable tablet for anybody,” he said. “It’s a ‘tweener. A real tablet offering has got to be a 10-inch screen.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the reporters on this story: Brad Stone at bstone12@bloomberg.net; Danielle Kucera in San Francisco at dkucera6@bloomberg.net NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net ||||| This morning in New York City, Amazon will unveil a brand new, color screen reader or tablet. At least that's the current thinking. It may be called the Amazon Kindle Color, The Kindle 4 or, simply, Amazon Fire (in keeping with Amazon's love of pyrotechnic metaphors). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon's reps aren't saying what the product will be called. In fact, they're not even acknowledging the existence of a product. Regardless, the Seattle-based online retail giant does not summon the media to the Big Apple for a software update or new offers program on its Kindle e-ink reader.

So sit back and enjoy, and don't forget to tell us in the comments if you want what Bezos is selling. ||||| Technology NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Corrects to magazine version.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Bezos is channeling Steve Jobs. It’s mid-September and the wiry billionaire founder of Amazon.com (AMZN) is at his brand-new corporate headquarters in Seattle, in a building named Day One South after his conviction that 17-year-old Amazon is still in its infancy. Almost giddy with excitement, Bezos retrieves one by one the new crop of dirt-cheap Kindle e-readers—they start at $79—from a hidden perch on a chair tucked into a conference room table. When he’s done showing them off, he stands up, and, for an audience of a single journalist, announces, “Now, I’ve got one more thing to show you.” He waits a half-beat to make sure the reference to Jobs’s famous line from Apple (AAPL) presentations hasn’t been missed, then gives his notorious barking laugh. With that, Bezos pulls out the Kindle Fire, Amazon’s long-anticipated tablet computer—and the first credible response to the Apple iPad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike a wave of other tablets that have emerged hopefully only to flop, such as the HP TouchPad, the Motorola Xoom, and the RIM PlayBook, the Kindle Fire has a good shot at turning the newest theater of war in high-tech into a two-tablet battle. With a 7-inch display, the Fire is about half the size of the iPad. At $199, it’s also less than half the price of the cheapest Apple model. Amazon has painted over the rough surfaces of Google’s (GOOG) Android operating system with a fresh and easy-to-use interface and tied the device closely to its own large and growing content library. Kindle Fire owners can watch the film Rio, scroll through magazines such as The New Yorker or Esquire, and access their music collection on Amazon’s servers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What we are doing is offering premium products at non-premium prices,” Bezos says. Other tablet contenders “have not been competitive on price” and “have just sold a piece of hardware. We don’t think of the Kindle Fire as a tablet. We think of it as a service.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To demonstrate the Kindle Fire, Bezos pulls up a chair. He proudly shows off a lightning-fast Web browser that runs on Amazon’s EC2 cloud computing engine and Amazon’s version of the Android app store, with over 10,000 games, e-mail programs, shopping guides, and the like. Bezos pauses briefly to exhibit his dexterity at a game called Fruit Ninja, zapping watermelons and kiwis that fly across the screen, and appears to momentarily lose himself in the effort. “I do find it strangely therapeutic, uncomfortably therapeutic,” he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are some limitations to the Kindle Fire. Unlike the iPad 2, it doesn’t have embedded cameras or a microphone, and there’s no 3G cellular connection, only Wi-Fi. Its diminutive size, which makes it so handy for stashing in a coat pocket, also makes it unlikely to satisfy more than one antsy kid on a long car ride. The versatile iPad 2, with its video chatting capabilities and exquisite screen resolution, is a lifestyle-defining objet d’art. The stripped-down Fire is more of a sit-back-on-the-sofa-and-shop device. It crystallizes the difference between Apple, which tends to keep prices (and profit margins) high, and Amazon, which likes to start low and drive lower in an effort to knee-cap the competition. The tablet is symbolic of Amazon’s remarkable ability to adapt and reluctance to cede the future to anyone. If the Fire and its inevitable sequels are successful, they will add even more might to one of the fastest-growing retail operations the world has ever seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon’s 1990s slogan—”Earth’s largest bookstore”—stood for an ambition that now seems cute. Amazon boasted of its unlimited selection of books, even though in most cases it was simply having them shipped directly from distributors. Today, Amazon sells millions of goods and services, from toys and high-definition televisions to server space for other Internet companies and digital reading devices for book lovers. Borders found it impossible to match Amazon’s selection and went out of business earlier this year. Best Buy (BBY) has watched Amazon undercut it and commoditize whole product categories, and is now trying to shrink the square footage of its superstores. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) has struggled to match the ease and reliability of Amazon’s shipping network, and posted nine straight quarters of declining same-store sales. Websites that have matched Amazon in selection, price, and customer service—Zappos, Diapers.com—Bezos has quickly acquired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Amazon is not a fight-on-their-knees kind of company,” says Rob Glaser, the Seattle entrepreneur behind RealNetworks (RNWKD) and now also a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. “Jeff’s a hyper-competitor.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As its rivals steadily asphyxiate, Amazon is ringing up 50 percent growth in quarterly revenues, and could reach $50 billion in sales this year. Walmart needed almost twice the time—33 years—to cross that threshold. “Amazon is such a smart learning organization,” says Nancy F. Koehn, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “It’s like a biological organism that through natural selection and adaptation just keeps learning and growing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon is also facing a new kind of challenge that competitors like Walmart are intimately familiar with—cultural backlash, or at least the early signs of it. The company has been criticized for waging an expensive state-by-state battle to avoid collecting sales taxes, and more recently for skimping on air conditioning in its East Coast distribution centers during a brutally hot summer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the Kindle Fire is half as good as it looked in Bezos’ conference room, it will fan the fears about Amazon’s growing dominance. The tablet funnels users into Amazon’s meticulously constructed world of content, commerce, and cloud computing. Just like owners of Kindle e-reading devices tend to start buying all their books from Amazon, Kindle Fire owners are likely to hand over an increasing chunk of their entertainment budget to Jeff Bezos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tablets represent a huge opportunity for Bezos, not only to sell a new kind of device but also to entice people to buy more stuff. Even with only 28.7 million iPads sold, e-commerce sites say they see an increasing amount of traffic coming from tablets. Forrester Research (FORR) reported this summer that online purchases made on tablets now account for 20 percent of all mobile e-commerce sales, and that nearly 60 percent of tablet owners have used them to shop. Bezos says tablets “are a huge tailwind for our business.” Amazon once saw spikes in traffic during the workday lunch hours. Now traffic is more evenly distributed as people pick up their tablets anytime of the week, buying the books and albums they see on television and making impulsive decisions about replacing their dishwashers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kindle Fire (internal code name: Otter) is designed to ensure that even more of those purchases go to Amazon. The company has built a tablet-optimized shopping application, with simplified and streamlined pages but none of the clutter of the main website. The app is pre-installed and sits at the bottom of the Fire’s main screen (users can get rid of it if they want). The device also comes with the enticement of a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime, the company’s $79-a-year two-day delivery program that tends to convert members into Amazon addicts who triple or even quadruple the amount they spend on the site. Since March, Amazon has also administered its own app store for Android devices, culling Google’s more comprehensive selection and removing everything that’s offensive and unreliable. Kindle Fire owners will have access to apps from Pandora (P), Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix (NFLX). Other competitors such as Barnes & Noble (BKS) can submit their apps, but it will be much easier for Kindle Fire owners to find Amazon’s own content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s one reason Amazon is in the best position to turn the tablet battle into a two-combatant war. The other is price. Analysts speculating on the new device widely pegged the Kindle Fire at $250 to $300. (Samsung, RIM (RIMM), and others have entered the tablet race with similar devices at those prices and above.) Bezos is able to go lower because he can make his profit on media content and with additional subscriptions to Amazon Prime—which then will drive additional purchases of toys, toasters, diapers, etc. He’s also exploiting his company’s popular cloud computing initiative, called Amazon Web Services. Amazon saves money on the Kindle Fire by packing it with only 8 gigabytes of memory (the costliest version of the iPad has 64 gigs), but owners of the device get to store as many books, songs, movies, and personal documents on Amazon’s cloud servers as they like for free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bezos won’t say whether he thinks he’ll lose money on the device itself, only that he’s at ease flirting with red ink. “Certainly this is a for-profit business,” he says. “Let’s put it this way. We are and always have been very comfortable at operating at extremely low margins.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the decision to design and build its own hardware is a high-stakes bet, it’s equally true that Bezos had no choice but to enter the tablet business. About 40 percent of Amazon’s revenues comes from media—books, music, and movies—and those formats are rapidly going digital. Amazon was late to understand the speed of that transition; Apple, which launched the iPod in 2001 and iTunes two years later, wasn’t. The iPad has only strengthened Apple’s hold over digital media. There’s a Kindle app for the iPad, but Apple takes a 30 percent slice of all content that app makers sell on the tablet and has restricted Amazon from directing iPad users to its website in order to avoid giving Apple its cut. Doing business on the iPad threatens Amazon’s already thin profit margins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bezos claims he doesn’t think defensively. “Everything we do is driven by seeing opportunity rather than being worried about defending,” he says. Given Apple’s inroads into the media business, that’s hard to believe. Bezos is magnanimous toward Jobs. “On a personal level we have a tremendous amount of respect for Apple and Steve. I think that’s returned,” he says. “Our cultures start in the same place. Both companies like to invent, both companies like to pioneer, both companies start with the customer and work backwards. There’s a like-mindedness.” Pause. “Are two companies like Amazon and Apple occasionally going to step on each others toes? Yes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon has recovered more quickly than other tech companies in the race to catch up with Apple in digital media. Amazon introduced an online TV and movie store in 2006, the Kindle e-book store in 2007, and the MP3 digital music store in 2008. Earlier this year, Amazon also aimed its sights on Netflix with an Instant Video streaming service that’s free for members of Amazon Prime, and it’s now spending hundreds of millions to increase its catalog with TV shows and movies from studios like Fox (NWS) and NBCUniversal. The music and video stores haven’t been huge hits. That may change on the Kindle Fire. On a tablet those apps will give users the impression that most songs, TV shows, and movies are just a click away. “We are leaning into this,” Bezos says. “It’s not a small initiative for us.” Amazon is also among the companies in the final round of bidding for the online video site Hulu, according to people with knowledge of that process who were not allowed to speak on the record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple’s success with the iPod taught the entire tech industry another valuable lesson. There were other digital music players on the market back in the 1990s, but Apple’s device, which seamlessly blended hardware, software, and eventually an online service in iTunes, made the experience simple and unintimidating for non-techies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a sense, as one easily holds the Kindle Fire in one hand (try doing that with an iPad), that Bezos is working from the same set of principles as Jobs: Content matters. Simplicity is key. How do companies allow users to easily buy songs, movies, and other digital goodies? They persuade customers to entrust them with their credit cards—as both Amazon and Apple have done. How do they ensure that the device is easy to use? They design and build it themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What should Amazon be doing in 20 years?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the first question Bezos asked Jateen Parekh, a Silicon Valley systems engineer who had worked for the digital video recorder pioneer Replay-TV, an early TiVo (TIVO) rival, and Philips Research, a division of the Dutch consumer electronics maker. It was August 2004, and Bezos and his new senior vice-president in charge of worldwide digital media, Steven Kessel, were exploring what seemed like a radical idea for an online retailer: making their own hardware. “The question impressed me,” recalls Parekh, who is now the founder and chief technology officer of digital radio startup Jelli. “The fact that the CEO was thinking that far out was huge.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parekh joined Amazon that September, becoming the first employee of Lab126, a secret Silicon Valley skunkworks. At first, Parekh didn’t have an office to report to: He and the few industrial designers and engineers hired soon after, including Gregg Zehr, a former vice-president of hardware engineering at Palm Computing, set up shop in an empty room in the offices of A9, Amazon’s Palo Alto (Calif.)-based search subsidiary. Parekh recalls spending his first few weeks investigating the possibility of building Internet-connected set-top boxes and even an MP3 player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bezos loved reading far more than listening to music, and Amazon had deep expertise in the book market, so the next decision was a natural one. Amazon’s new hardware geeks would build an e-reader. Parekh and Zehr, who became president of the new division, researched existing e-readers of the time, such as the Sony Librie, which required AAA batteries, sold poorly, and never made it out of Japan. They concluded the market was wide open. “It was the one thing that wasn’t being done well by anyone else out there,” Parekh says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First, though, Amazon’s engineers needed a better name for the original “A2Z Development Corp.” Parekh and his colleagues hated it, and thought it ill-suited to luring the best and brightest engineers from places like Apple and Palm. They eventually settled on the more mysterious “Lab126.” The 1 stands for a, the 26 for z, a geeky naming convention inside Amazon where groups like the personalization team are referred to by the abbreviation P13N. (If you’re confused by that, count the letters in the word “personalization.”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other people who worked for Lab126 in those early years recall it as a loosely managed startup. The group piggybacked on A9′s infrastructure for most of the next year. When the search division moved to the former offices of a Palo Alto law firm, Lab126 moved with them and took up residence in the old law library. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lab126 was eventually given nearly unlimited resources. It also had to contend with the unfettered imagination of Bezos. Amazon’s founder wanted his new e-reading device to be drop-dead simple to use and argued that configuring devices to Wi-Fi networks was too complicated for non-tech-savvy users. He also didn’t want to force customers to connect the device to a PC, so the only alternative was to build cellular access into the device, the equivalent of embedding a wireless phone in the hardware. Nothing like that had been tried before. Bezos insisted that customers should never have to know the wireless connection was there or even pay for access. “I thought it was insane, I really did,” Parekh recalls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effort to develop the first Kindle ended up taking more than three years. Nearly everything went wrong. The black-and-white displays from E Ink, an offshoot of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab that makes screens resembling the printed page and requiring very little power, would look good for one month and then degrade alarmingly. Qualcomm (QCOM), which was set to provide the wireless chips, was sued by a competitor, Broadcom (BRCM), and for months was enjoined by a judge from selling its wares in the U.S. The Lab126 team repeatedly urged Bezos to make their project easier by considering a Wi-Fi-only connection for the Kindle. He rejected the idea, constantly suggesting new ones for complicated features, like the notion that customers’ annotations of books should be backed up on Amazon’s servers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That original Kindle, code-named “Fiona” after a character in Neal Stephenson’s futuristic novel The Diamond Age, was finally ready to go in the fall of 2007. Still, Amazon nearly blew it. Modeling demand after the first-year sales of the original iPod, Amazon dramatically underestimated what a hit the Kindle would turn out to be. The first batch sold out in just a few hours. Amazon then discovered that one of its Taiwanese suppliers had discontinued a key part and spent months getting a replacement. “You look at the history of the Kindle, they developed some real skills around the creation of that product. They’ve cut their teeth so to speak,” says Brian Blair, a New York-based analyst at Wedge Partners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Making four successive versions of the Kindle e-reader also led Amazon down the path toward the Kindle Fire. For years the engineers at Lab126 tried to create a workable and reader-friendly color Kindle, according to three former employees. New color display technologies like Qualcomm’s Mirasol and another MIT IT-offshoot called Pixel Qi proved unreliable and difficult to produce in large quantities. In January 2010, the iPad demonstrated the broad appeal of a new kind of color LCD tablet with better image quality, wider viewing angles, and, near to Amazon’s heart, Apple’s own selection of e-books. People close to Lab126 say that work on tablets, including the Kindle Fire, started soon after. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon’s devices division now employs around 800 hardware and software engineers in Cupertino, Calif., who fill up all but one floor of an entire eight-floor office building and part of a second building in the same office park, less than a mile from Apple’s corporate headquarters. In the unit’s industrial design lab, according to a person who has visited that top-secret floor but was not authorized to speak on the record, naked e-ink displays hang from the walls with images from books imprinted on their screens. They’re used to demonstrate to potential new hires how an e-ink screen can hold an image indefinitely without being connected to a power supply. There’s also another office of Kindle employees at Amazon’s new corporate campus in the South Lake Union district of Seattle, in a building nostalgically named Fiona. The group is cordoned off from other Amazon employees, whose company badges do not grant them access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bezos won’t say what kind of devices he’s cooking up next. People with knowledge of the division’s plans say that the Kindle Fire is only the first of a line of Amazon tablets, not an isolated product, and that the group has always considered the possibility of building Amazon cell phones and Internet-connected TVs. “We are a company with a lot of ideas,” Bezos says, when asked directly about his plans. And then, of course, he laughs uproariously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For those already competing with Amazon.com, the Kindle Fire will not be good news. Kevin Ryan, the co-owner of Green Apple Books, a 44-year-old bookstore in San Francisco, says that Amazon has lowered the prices in the book business beyond his ability to match them. Amazon has also locked up several big authors to publishing contracts, and though it says it will produce their books in print as well as digital formats, that has competing retailers nervous. “They’re bullies. They really are. I think they really want to be a monopoly,” Ryan says from the 8,000-square-foot store that features tribal masks over the bookshelves, and which has watched sales drop for much of the past decade. Of the growing group of authors like George R.R. Martin, whose books have sold over a million digital copies through Amazon, he says, “You have to assume that people joining the million book Kindle club is taking business away from you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past year major chains like Toys “R” Us, Sports Authority, and Radio Shack (RSH) have teamed up to combat Amazon’s might, forming a free shipping program called ShopRunner that, like Amazon Prime, also offers free two-day shipping for $79 a year. It’s not clear yet how ShopRunner is doing; the group won’t release subscriber numbers. Fiona Dias, ShopRunner’s chief strategy officer, says that by locking in a new wave of customers with the Kindle Fire, Amazon will make their jobs even harder. “It’s a phenomenal concentration of power,” she says. “If we were scared of Amazon in the Web world, we should be absolutely terrified of them in the tablet world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s not just competitors that are assessing Amazon’s dominance. Over the past year, lawmakers, the media, and even some customers have begun weighing Amazon’s growing sales and size against the impact for communities, commerce, and the local job market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon has brought some of this scrutiny on itself. It touts its hiring of workers for its growing network of shipping centers, yet those jobs aren’t exactly plumb: They start at around $11 an hour (with health benefits), and conditions can be tough. The recent newspaper account in the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call not only revealed that temperatures over the summer in a local Amazon facility reached 120F, but that workers who were slowed by the heat felt penalized by their bosses. (Amazon has promised to put in air conditioners.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report is consistent with a company that’s notoriously frugal with employees, who get few perks aside from 10 percent off $1,000 in annual purchases. Unlike Google and Apple, Amazon does not subsidize meals or provide free sodas. Even the pet dogs of Amazon employees get a better deal: There’s a bucket of free milk bones at the front desk of every company building in Seattle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The vicious, multi-state battle over state sales tax has created perhaps the most controversy around Amazon. Legislators in more than a dozen states, pressed by such politically connected competitors as Walmart, have been pushing Amazon to collect the sales tax that their customers technically already owe on online purchases, to better repair widening budget deficits and pay firemen and school teachers. Bezos has tenaciously fought that effort, arguing that only federal legislation can overrule a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 1992 that retailers with no physical presence in a state should not have to pay sales tax there. Critics have charged he’s just stringing out his price advantage as long as possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sept. 7, Amazon finally compromised in California, agreeing to start collecting sales tax in the state by November 2012. Bezos thinks that by then the federal government will uniformly set nationwide standards for the collection of online sales tax. “You have to do what you think is correct,” he says. “Obviously we care about perception, but we also value substance and the right place to fix this is in federal legislation.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Losing the tax advantage may not be such a bad thing. If and when Amazon starts collecting sales tax, it will be free to set up distribution centers right outside major cities, which would enable even faster deliveries than it offers now. As part of Amazon’s deal with California, for example, the company has pledged to spend $500 million on new warehouses and hire 10,000 full-time workers and 25,000 seasonal employees. Customers in California could soon end up getting same-day deliveries of products and even produce. Amazon’s experimental “Fresh” grocery program is now active in Seattle, where the company already collects sales tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nancy Koehn of Harvard Business School thinks Amazon may be getting big enough for people to finally start considering the ramifications—for towns, shopping centers, and jobs—of a world dominated by online buying. She recently discussed Amazon on Wisconsin Public Radio—not the most neutral forum—but was surprised when almost all of the phone calls from listeners were critical of the company. “Americans get very nervous about centralized power that affects their communities,” she says. “We get a little bit nervous about bigness, yet we want the convenience and the pricing and the material plenty that bigness allows.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon’s new Seattle campus testifies to that growing size. The company has leased 11 brand-new buildings in the burgeoning South Lake Union neighborhood from real estate developer and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen. It’s classic Amazon: unostentatious, and no company signs on any of the buildings. The entire campus is due to be completed by 2013 and will host several thousand employees, but the company is growing so fast, it’s already looking for even more space.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He’s right to sweat the details, especially now that his competition has gone from slow-moving big-box retailers to tech giants like Apple, which has even deeper deep pockets and is as comfortable with long-term investments as Amazon. “I believe these industries are so big, there are going to be multiple winners,” Bezos says. He’s been saying that for 10 years, during which time he’s helped consign Circuit City, Borders, and others to oblivion. “When I look at something like the Kindle Fire, what I want is to be one of the winners.”"}

More than 720,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. A UN report has called for senior military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for the crime of genocide.

Her administration has actively stirred up hostility against the Rohingya, labelling them as “terrorists”, accusing them of burning their own homes and decrying “faking rape”. Meanwhile state media has published inflammatory and dehumanizing articles alluding to the Rohingya as “detestable human fleas” and “thorns” which must be pulled out.

But in the two years since Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration assumed power, human rights defenders, peaceful activists and journalists have been arrested and imprisoned while others face threats, harassment and intimidation for their work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration has failed to repeal repressive laws – including some of the same laws which were used to detain her and others campaigning for democracy and human rights. Instead, she has actively defended the use of such laws, in particular the decision to prosecute and imprison two Reuters journalists for their work documenting a Myanmar military massacre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aung San Suu Kyi was named as Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience in 2009, in recognition of her peaceful and non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights. At the time she was held under house arrest, which she was eventually released from exactly eight years ago today. When she was finally able to accept the award in 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi asked Amnesty International to “not take either your eyes or your mind off us and help us to be the country where hope and history merges.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Amnesty International took Aung San Suu Kyi’s request that day very seriously, which is why we will never look away from human rights violations in Myanmar,” said Kumi Naidoo.

It is the first step toward giving the sign the protections of an official Boston Landmark, which would require any future changes to its appearance or structure to be approved by the commission. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The vote came as the result of online petition in the wake of plans by Boston University, which owns the building on which the sign is mounted, to sell that building and a handful of others nearby. The petition, organized by the Boston Preservation Alliance and signed by more than 5,000 people, described the sign this way: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It has encouraged many thousands of Marathon runners and its gleaming red triangle has presided over countless innings at Fenway Park. The sign is visible from almost every angle of the city and Cambridge serving as a beacon for the region. The CITGO sign isn't just an advertisement, it is a Boston landmark. For national audiences, it says \"Boston\" just as much as Old North Church and the Swan Boats.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston University is considering offers from developers who want to buy the Citgo-adorned building at 660 Beacon Street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sign itself is technically not included in the sale. According to the Boston Globe, it is owned by a company that leases the air rights above the building. But that lease agreement is at the discretion of the building's owner, which means the beloved and iconic symbol (or antiquated corporate-advertising monstrosity, depending on your position) could theoretically be removed by a developer, and the good people of Boston would have no say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unless, of course, the Citgo sign joins Boston Common, Quincy Market, and Faneuil Hall on the landmark list. Although it would not be the first modern site on the list — the Berkeley Building and Christian Science Center Complex are also protected by landmark status — the Citgo sign would arguably be the most tacky architectural item to make the cut. The Old North Church, of Paul Revere lantern-hanging fame, it is not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, that the Citgo sign is beloved to many Bostonians is beyond dispute. Since the building sale was announced in January, people have taken to Twitter to proclaim the sign's significance.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is a wonderful piece of American Pop Art from the 1960s,\" Arthur Krim, who studies preservation at Boston Architectural College, told the New York Times. \"It's become part of the language of the city, which I think everyone is quite surprised by.\" ||||| The Fight to Save the Citgo Sign Is a Proxy War for Boston’s Soul NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is about a lot more than a big, red triangle in the sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenmore Square has changed dramatically over the years while leaving select bits untouched by the march of progress—in a way, it’s a fitting microcosm of what’s happening all across Boston. While you’ll struggle to find this water trough for horses erected in the middle of the square by the MSPCA in 1908, or even more modern ephemera like the Rat, you could look at this picture taken in 1911 (or this one from around the same time) and immediately recognize a few buildings still standing there today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each week seems to bring news of another neighborhood mainstay in Boston falling victim to the bulldozer. A decade-old diner beloved by locals in Southie will soon be razed to make way for nine luxury condos and a 10-car garage, while the Littlest Bar near the Greenway has already been reduced to rubble for this BRA-approved brain fart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the first time since 1982, the beloved Citgo sign in Kenmore Square could face an equally ignominious demise as the neighborhood undergoes yet another transformation. Back then, the petroleum giant planned to remove the sign after the nationwide energy crisis turned the lights off for four years. This time, it’s a red-hot housing market that could spell the end for the icon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That we’re even having this sort of conversation about that blinking, 3,600-square-foot fixture of the Boston skyline is emblematic of an overarching question nagging this new, resurgent Hub: Are we losing what makes us uniquely Boston in the granite-countertopped euphoria of the city’s building boom? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR News broke in January that Boston University, which has played a dominant role in transforming Kenmore Square from ground-zero of the city’s punk scene to something a little more seemly for visiting parents, had hired real estate firm Newmark Grubb Knight Frank to sell off 334,000 square-feet of commercial space across nine buildings there, including the one whose roof the Citgo sign has called home since 1965. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Citgo sign itself, however, is not necessarily part of the deal. Part advertisement, part pop-art masterpiece, the sign is maintained by Federal Heath Sign Company, which leases the air rights above 660 Beacon Street from BU. It will be up to the new owner to decide whether to renew this lease, or scrap the sign and build up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are lots of ways to adaptively reuse buildings and come up with viable economic solutions that don’t require tearing them down and turning a five-, six-story building into a 30-story building,” says Greg Galer, executive director of the nonprofit Boston Preservation Alliance. “Unfortunately, there’s this common misconception, maybe too common, that the only way to have a viable project is to go big and tall, and destroy the historic character of the buildings.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city’s Landmarks Commission met Tuesday night and granted the Citgo sign “pending designation” status. Next, the commission will prepare a report, and a public meeting will be held. If the commission approves its landmark status by a two-thirds vote, Mayor Marty Walsh has 15 days to approve or reject the proposal. If he rejects it, the City Council has 30 days to override his decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Preservation Alliance, which successfully campaigned to save Southie’s 19th century Collins Mansion from a developer’s wrecking ball, drafted its own non-binding petition to solicit public support for the preservation effort. As of Wednesday morning, it has garnered more than 5,100 signatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We thought this was one that people would get excited about and support. We know how much this is an icon of the city, and it’s recognized not only by Bostonians, but people all around the country, as our petition will show,” Galer says. “I saw someone posted from Brazil supporting it, that they used to live in Boston—I don’t know if they came to school here or whatever—and whenever they see the Citgo sign from back home in Brazil, they think of the city.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Councilor Josh Zakim, whose district includes Kenmore Square, admits that while he hopes the Citgo sign can stick around, the matter hasn’t been a major concern for the Council, which recently passed Walsh’s $2.68 billion budget. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It certainly has not, during out budget process, come up,” Zakim says. “I don’t want to minimize how nice it is to have the sign, but it’s not been a top issue we’re hearing from constituents. I think people are happy and want to keep it there, but you know as well as I do, the issues we’re hearing about in the Fenway area are traffic, affordable housing—issues that are much more in the forefront of people’s everyday lives.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zakim says that Citgo has taken an “active role” in trying to preserve the sign. (The Houston-based company could not be reached for comment.) Meanwhile, BU spokesperson Colin Riley told the Herald Tuesday that interested developers have all supplied the university with concepts that leave the Citgo sign untouched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think Boston University has generally had a good relationship with their neighbors, and has been a good institutional citizen in Boston,” he says, “and I certainly hope that as the surrounding neighborhood makes their opinions heard on the Citgo sign and future development there, it will be taken seriously and addressed both by BU, the current landowner, and any potential purchasers of the parcels.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After all, what an albatross that would be–forever the folks who dismantled a piece of Boston iconography. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People recognize that the city needs to change and evolve, that we need new construction, we need new housing, we need all these things,” Galer says. “But people are really starting to feel that we’re nibbling away at the core character aspects of these various neighborhoods, and I think the Citgo sign is just a clear indication of that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BU says transforming Kenmore Square into a “commercial gateway” to its Charles River campus has been a priority since 1986, four years after it first bought property there, “when head shops and noisy nightclubs pockmarked the area.” A major player in this change was the four-star Hotel Commonwealth, built by the university in 2003 and spun off in 2012. But general manager Adam Sperling says the hotel only stands to benefit from the Citgo sign staying put. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I will tell you, anecdotally, I don’t think that a day’s ever gone by that I don’t see somebody out in front of the hotel taking a picture of [the sign],” Sperling says. “If you ask my doorman, he’ll tell you he engages in conversation about that sign every day he works here. People want to know what it is.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s a giant, red triangle on a field of white that fills and depletes over and over, and over. How fitting, that a city that wears its emotions on its sleeve has a heartbeat visible from miles away. ||||| For half a century, Bostonians and visitors alike have identified with the iconic CITGO sign rooted on 660 Beacon Street in Kenmore Square.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sign’s fate has been clouded in recent months amid BU’s plan to sell 660 Beacon — the building that the sign stands on — and several neighboring properties. Real estate experts have noted that any new owner would likely want to build on the site, which could lead to moving, blocking, or even taking down the sign, which has loomed above Kenmore Square since 1965 and is visible from many corners of Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BU has said it is encouraging potential buyers to include the sign in any projects, and that all the parties it’s talking with “responded with concepts that include the sign.” But local preservationists are pushing for more concrete protections and have gathered more than 5,000 signatures via an online petition to grant the sign landmark status.

Stokes is accused of trying to blow up a... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — A prosecutor was critical Monday of store surveillance footage from a new documentary about the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, calling it a heavily edited attempt to distort an incident that occurred several hours before Brown died in an encounter with a police officer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Filmmaker Jason Pollock responded by calling St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch a \"master of deception\" and standing by the video shown in his documentary \"Stranger Fruit.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCulloch released five surveillance videos from the early hours of Aug. 9, 2014, at Ferguson Market & Liquor that he said are unedited and tell a different story than filmmakers suggest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The footage as it appears in the documentary \"was clearly an attempt to distort this and turn it into something it isn't,\" McCulloch said at a news conference. He added that it was potentially dangerous, setting off a Sunday night protest of about 100 people that included reports of shots fired and the arrest of a man accused of trying to blow up a police car by putting a napkin in the gas tank and trying to light it. Henry Stokes, 44, was charged Monday with attempting to cause a catastrophe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday night, a few dozen protesters gathered peacefully outside Ferguson Market while police officers guarded the store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollock said there was no deceptive editing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He's trying to make it seem like I did something that I didn't,\" Pollock said of McCulloch on Monday in a phone interview. \"He's a master at deception, I'll give him that, and he tricked the world for a long time, but he can't trick us now. Because anybody who sees that video knows exactly what they see.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, shortly after noon on Aug. 9, 2014. The shooting set off months of sometimes violent protests. Wilson was eventually cleared of wrongdoing by both a St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days of Brown's death, Ferguson police released surveillance video from Ferguson Market purporting to show Brown stealing cigarillos from the store shortly before noon. He left the store and was walking on Canfield Drive when Wilson told him to get on the sidewalk and off the street — the beginning of their fatal confrontation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documentary, which premiered Saturday, includes earlier and previously unseen surveillance footage showing Brown inside the store at 1:14 a.m. getting what appears to be two drinks from a cooler, then going to the counter and requesting cigarillos. The clerk puts the drinks and cigarillos in a bag. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown gives something to a clerk, who appears to sniff it. A second clerk also sniffs what appears to be a small bag. Brown starts to leave but then returns to the counter, talks to the clerks and leaves without the bag containing the drinks and cigarillos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollock said he believes the footage shows Brown trading a small amount of marijuana in exchange for the cigarillos. Pollock reasons Brown returned 10 hours later to pick up the bag of cigarillos that he simply had set aside earlier — not to steal cigarillos as police claimed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jay Kanzler, an attorney for Ferguson Market, said there was no bartered deal between Brown and the market workers. Kanzler said Brown offered marijuana for cigarillos, but the workers refused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCulloch agreed \"there was no transaction between Mr. Brown and the store employees.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And the suggestion that he's coming back to pick up what he bartered for is just stupid,\" McCulloch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The grainy unedited footage, which has no sound and also was released by Kanzler, shows a clerk pulling both boxes of cigarillos from the bag after Brown leaves and putting them back on a shelf. Another worker takes the drinks back toward the cooler. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollock said those actions are not relevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I didn't edit the exchange,\" Pollock said. \"I decided to end my scene after Michael left the store because after that it is irrelevant what happened to the (cigarillos) and it is irrelevant what they (the clerks) did with them. The exchange is over, they had the weed, and then he decided to leave the store. He did not rob the store.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollock said the clerks lied because they didn't want to admit to involvement in a drug deal. But McCulloch said there was no evidence the workers did anything wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newly released footage also raised questions about how forthcoming police and prosecutors were about evidence. McCulloch said the earlier store encounter involving Brown was noted in a police report released on the night in November 2014 when he announced the grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson, who later resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor said that video was never released because the incident did not result in any charges and the footage was \"immaterial\" to what happened later that day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR St. Louis County's NAACP chapter said it's \"deeply concerned\" about the footage that's now surfacing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Regardless of what was revealed in the video, Michael Brown should have never lost his life,\" board member John Gaskin III said in a statement. \"If the (documentary) video is accurate and valid, it is unfortunate that Brown was portrayed internationally as a 'thief' and 'criminal.' It remains injudicious that so many men of color are racially profiled on an ongoing basis and far too frequently guilty until proven innocent in the United States' criminal justice system.\" ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR / Updated By Jon Schuppe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A video that shows Michael Brown hours before he was shot to death by police in Ferguson, Missouri has sparked a new wave of anger ─ but no more clarity ─ about a 2014 killing that prompted a national debate on race and policing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A crowd of protesters gathered outside Ferguson Market & Liquor Sunday night, calling for a boycott of the store where the footage was shot. Three people were arrested, two for assaulting a police officer and another for allegedly stuffing a rag into a police car's exhaust pipe and trying to light it, authorities said. Also during the protests, someone from a dark-colored car fired six or seven shots toward the protest, striking a police cruiser but injuring no one, police said. The car got away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR St. Louis County's top prosecutor on Monday mocked the filmmaker behind the footage's release, calling his work \"pathetic\" and an \"attempt to distort and turn this into something it wasn't.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documentary, \"Stranger Fruit,\" debuted at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas on Saturday. It includes parts of a previously unreleased surveillance video inside Ferguson Market & Liquor early on Aug. 9, 2014, several hours before Brown's fatal confrontation with police. It shows Brown place an object on the counter, which the clerk smells. Brown is then given a box of cigarillos and begins to leave but returns and hands the cigarillos back to the clerk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film's director, Jason Pollock, has said the footage shows Brown trading marijuana for the cigarillos and leaving the boxes at the store for safekeeping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That, Pollack has said, raises questions about police assertions that Brown had been suspected of robbing the store of cigarillos later that day ─ an encounter that was also caught on surveillance footage but was released by police a few days after Brown's death in an attempt to explain why he was stopped soon afterward by the officer who shot him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the documentary, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, says in the film that \"there was some type of exchange.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown's family, which has sued Ferguson for Michael Brown's death, declined to comment this week on the video, a spokesman for the family's lawyer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the market and chief prosecutor dispute the filmmaker's interpretation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There was no transaction, no deal made for what he [Michael Brown] had in that bag, \"Jay Kanzler, a lawyer who represents the store's owners and workers, told NBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kanzler said no one from the film interviewed him or his clients about the footage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police line up in front of the Ferguson Market & Liquor during a protest, following a release of previously undisclosed video of Michael Brown, on March 12. Lawrence Bryant / Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, called a Monday afternoon press conference where he called Pollack's film \"poorly edited\" and \"an attempt to generate his 15 minutes, which he got.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCulloch released unedited copies of the surveillance footage, which he said shows a failed attempt to barter cigarillos for something that might have been drugs. After Brown returned the cigarillos, and some cold drinks, to the clerks, they put the items back on the shelves, McColloch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That encounter, McCulloch said, had nothing to do with the later alleged robbery, and had no bearing on the shooting ─ which is why authorities never presented it to a grand jury, and never released it publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The grand jury declined to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The assertion that Brown returned to the store just before his death to pick up something he'd bartered for \"is just stupid,\" McColloch said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To those critics, the emergence of the new video helps prove their point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are interpreting a video. It can be interpreted in multiple ways, that’s true. But it's also likely true that police know about this and decided to run with a story that was likely inaccurate,\" said Brendan Roediger, a professor at St. Louis University School of Law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kanzler said the newly released video was handed over to authorities at the same time as the footage showing Brown forcing his way out of the store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not sure why it has not been talked about before,\" Kanzler said."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this patient's case, \"it is clear that the religious experience represented a fracture\" from her prior behavior that was \"not preceded by a gradual change in her thinking and acting,\" the researchers, from the Hospital General Universitario Morales Meseguer in Murcia, Spain, wrote in their paper, published online Dec. 12, 2016, in the journal Neurocase. \"Nor was there any kind of trigger or reason [for the behavior change] except for the disease, and hence, it can be considered a clearly pathological experience,\" they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's not clear how often people experience \"hyper-religiosity\" or other behavior changes as their first symptom of a brain tumor, the researchers said. One review found that up to 22 percent of all brain tumors may first appear along with psychotic symptoms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From this one case, it's not possible to pinpoint the part of the brain responsible for the women's religious experience, the researchers said. But, they note that the right temporal lobe, a brain region that has previously been linked to the development of mystical experiences, also appeared to be involved in the woman's case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also said that, before the woman's extreme religious behavior, she did believe in God, so this \"was not a case of religious conversion.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman's condition quickly declined — she experienced a stroke two months after she started treatment, the report said. Eight months after her cancer diagnosis, she died due to the progression of her tumor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also suspect that, before her cancer diagnosis, the patient may have experienced non-convulsive seizures, possibly as a result of her brain tumor. They suspected this because of particular changes they saw in her brain scan. Some cases of hyper-religious behavior have also been reported in people with epilepsy, according to the report. However, the researchers were unable to perform tests to confirm the epilepsy diagnosis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Original article on Live Science."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The party has received complaints that the comments breach its code of conduct, and under Conservative rules they must be investigated by an independent panel. Possible penalties include expulsion from the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The party confirmed it had received complaints but declined to give details Thursday, saying that the process is confidential. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story continues below advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservative code of conduct says members should “lead by example to encourage and foster respect and tolerance.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson, who quit the government last month in a dispute over Brexit, wrote in the Daily Telegraph this week that it was “absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes.” He said he opposed banning burqas and other face-covering garments worn by some Muslim women, but referred to a woman wearing the attire as “looking like a bank robber.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson’s comments were criticized by Muslim groups and politicians including Prime Minister Theresa May, who urged Johnson to apologize. He has not said sorry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tousle-headed Johnson is one of Britain’s best-known politicians, a popular but divisive figure known for Latin quips and verbal blunders that have included calling Papua New Guineans cannibals and accusing people in Liverpool of “wallowing” in victimhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics claim Johnson is using the burqa comments to boost his appeal among right-wing members of the party. Many expect May to face a leadership challenge soon if faltering Brexit negotiations with the European Union don’t improve — and Johnson is likely to be a contender to replace her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is popular with the pro-Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, which is deeply divided over its attitude to the EU. His Brexiteer credentials were bolstered when he resigned as foreign secretary in July, accusing May of killing “the Brexit dream” with her plan to seek close economic ties with the bloc after Brexit next year. ||||| Tory peer says Boris Johnson should lose the whip as he continues to defy order to apologise NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pressure on Boris Johnson over his controversial remarks about women in burqas is mounting across the Conservative party a day after the former foreign secretary was rebuked by Theresa May. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Conservative peer said Johnson should have the whip withdrawn, while a cabinet member called on him to retract his words and use language more carefully, as the row started by the man seen as a possible party leader continued into a third day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prime minister criticised Johnson over his claim that Muslim women in burqas resemble letterboxes and bank robbers, urging him to apologise after he defied an order to do so by Tory chiefs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she agreed with the Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, that Johnson should say sorry for his remarks, which she acknowledged had caused offence in the Muslim community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May urged people to be “very careful” about the language they used to discuss sensitive issues such as women wearing the burqa, but stopped short of saying Johnson’s comments were Islamophobic or that he should lose the Tory whip, meaning he would no longer represent the party in parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All apologies: the many times Boris Johnson has been told to say sorry Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following her intervention, Lord Sheikh, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, set up to encourage British Muslims to get involved in political life, called for the party to withdraw the whip from Johnson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Take the whip from him. Why not? He’s not a super human being, he’s a member of the party. The party chairman, the prime minister has the right to take the whip … that’s the thing I’d like to see,” he told the BBC’s Newsnight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further pressure was put on the former foreign secretary by the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, who said Johnson should have chosen his language more carefully. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When you are discussing a subject such as this, then I think describing it as people looking like letterboxes isn’t helpful. I think we should all choose our language with care,” he told the BBC’s Today programme on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said he was “sure on reflection” that Johnson would want to reconsider the language he had used, but he sidestepped questions over whether the MP should have the whip removed, saying: “That’s not a decision for me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eric Pickles, a former Tory chairman, told Today: “The very sensible thing would be for him to apologise.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The peer and former communities secretary said he did not understand Johnson’s motives and claimed his comments had closed down the debate on face veils. “There are tensions now that exist within the community, a degree of hatred out there that I’ve not witnessed for a good few years,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It came as Conservative party chiefs sought to dampen the Islamophobia row that has re-erupted since Johnson’s remarks in response to Denmark’s introduction of a ban on burqas in public places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sidestepping the question of whether the former foreign secretary was Islamophobic, May had said: “I have said it’s very clear that anybody who is talking about this needs to think very carefully about the language that they use and the impact that language has had on people, and it is clear that the language that Boris used has offended people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May was emphatic that women in the UK ought to be able to choose freely what they wanted to wear. “What is important is do we believe that people have the right to practise their religion, should have the right to choose – in the case of women, and the burqa and the niqab – how they dress,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is absolutely that women should be able to choose how they dress and shouldn’t be told how to do it by other people. And I believe that all of us when we talk about these issues should be very careful about the language that we use.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR May also said: “Some of the terms that Boris used in describing people’s appearance obviously have offended people and so I agree with Brandon Lewis.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday night, Johnson – who is believed to be on holiday in Europe – continued to defy via Twitter Lewis’s order to apologise for his remarks. He is understood to view the instruction as an attempt to shut down debate on a difficult issue that should be tackled head-on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brandon Lewis (@BrandonLewis) I agree with @AlistairBurtUK. I have asked @BorisJohnson to apologise. https://t.co/RFExXO4LOR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Johnson faced criticism from Tory politicians and Muslim groups for his comments, which some claimed were designed to pander to rightwing voters to bolster his future leadership chances. He came under fire recently for meeting the former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former Tory chairman Sayeeda Warsi, who has accused Johnson of “dog-whistle” Islamophobia, told Sky News on Tuesday: “Boris knew what he was doing when he made those comments, when he chose to use this very specific language he would know the impact and the effect it would have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think Boris is making yet another leadership bid and he will do and say whatever needs to be done to make that as successful as he can … I sincerely hope that he doesn’t continue to use Muslim women as a convenient political football to try and increase his poll ratings.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservative party has been accused of a lack of action on tackling Islamophobia in its ranks after Lewis said in June that diversity training would be offered to all members, and local associations would report back on how complaints were handled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before May’s intervention, a number of Tory MPs had criticised Johnson’s remarks. Alistair Burt, the minister for the Middle East, who worked under him, described them as offensive and said he would never have said anything similar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He told the BBC that Johnson had been defending Muslim women’s right to wear the religious dress. But he added: “I would never have made such a comment. I think there is a degree of offence in that, absolutely right.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fiyaz Mughal, the founder of Tell Mama, which campaigns against anti-Muslim violence, said Johnson’s comments amounted to Islamophobia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These are the kind of comments we have seen that have been made by extremist far-right groups and people who have been maliciously attacking Muslims, so clearly it does fit that bracket,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shadow equalities minister, Naz Shah, said: “Boris Johnson’s comments were not just offensive, they were Islamophobic, but the prime minister is in denial. An apology is not enough, she needs to order an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in her party, as requested by the Muslim community, and take action against him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shazia Awan-Scully, a former Tory parliamentary candidate, accused Johnson of “pandering to the extreme right”, comparing his comments to Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, and said he should be sacked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you cast your mind back 50 years to when Enoch Powell gave his rivers of blood speech, he was sacked from the shadow cabinet immediately,” she told Newsnight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his column for the Telegraph on Monday, Johnson said Muslim women wearing burqas looked like bank robbers, and schools and universities should be entitled to tell students to remove them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said it was “absolutely ridiculous” that wearers should “go around looking like letterboxes”, and he would expect his constituents to remove them in his MP’s surgery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Johnson said he did not support a blanket ban on the face veil in the UK. “You risk turning people into martyrs, and you risk a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation, and you may simply make the problem worse,” he wrote. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters gathered in Uxbridge, Mr Johnson's constituency, on Thursday NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boris Johnson is facing a possible investigation into breaches of the Conservative Party code of conduct. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The party has received dozens of complaints about the ex-foreign secretary's comments about Muslim women wearing burkas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complaints will be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The party declined to comment on the details of the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Conservative Party spokesman said: \"The code of conduct process is strictly confidential.\" A source close to Mr Johnson offered no comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile more than 30 protesters have gathered in Mr Johnson's constituency of Uxbridge, calling for his resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Johnson has rejected calls to apologise for saying people wearing burkas looked like \"letter boxes\" or \"bank robbers\", in a Daily Telegraph column in which he also argued against a ban on full-face veils. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics have accused him of stoking Islamophobia to boost his Tory leadership ambitions but his supporters have said he was speaking up for \"liberal values\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It comes as a watchdog which advises ex-ministers on taking new jobs ruled that Mr Johnson broke ministerial rules by taking up his weekly column at the Telegraph without consulting it first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The party's code of conduct states that Tory officials and elected representatives must \"lead by example to encourage and foster respect and tolerance\" and not \"use their position to bully, abuse, victimise, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The independent panel will decide whether to refer Mr Johnson to the party's board. Possible action includes suspension of membership or expulsion from the party among other, lesser sanctions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright PA Image caption Cressida Dick: Johnson did not commit an offence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and leader Theresa May have both called on Mr Johnson to apologise for his comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Lord Sheikh, has written to Mr Lewis demanding \"serious action\", while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became prime minister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A hundred Muslim women who wear the niqab or burka have signed a letter to Mr Lewis, calling on him to withdraw the Conservative whip from Mr Johnson and launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are not forced to make these clothing choices, nor are we oppressed,\" the women write in their letter, which has been issued to the media by the Muslim Council of Britain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They say Mr Johnson's words will \"inflame tensions in a way that makes it easier for bigots to justify hate crimes against us\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Azmat Parveen, who attended the protest in Uxbridge on Thursday, called Mr Johnson's comments \"painful\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a way of life, I want to choose this way and somebody remarks on it, I can't bear it, it is very, very rude,\" the 68-year-old said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I want him to leave his seat.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Legitimate debate' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said that while many have found Mr Johnson's remarks offensive, officers had decided that he did not commit an offence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also confirmed that police have not received any criminal complaint against the former foreign secretary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I also know that many other people believe strongly that in the whole of the article, what Mr Johnson appears to have been attempting to do was to say that there shouldn't be a ban and that he was engaging in a legitimate debate,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked what she made of the language used by the ex-cabinet minister, Ms Dick told the BBC Asian Network: \"Some people have clearly found it offensive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I spoke last night to my very experienced officers who deal with hate crime and, although we have not yet received any allegation of such a crime, I can tell you that my preliminary view having spoken to them is that what Mr Johnson said would not reach the bar for a criminal offence. He did not commit a criminal offence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: \"I am proud to police in a liberal democracy in which people have the right to express their opinions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What Mr Johnson said, if it is not criminal, is a matter for Mr Johnson and his friends and colleagues and indeed for the Conservative Party.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police and Crown Prosecution Service define a hate crime as \"any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on a person's disability or perceived disability; race or perceived race; or religion or perceived religion; or sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation or transgender identity or perceived transgender identity\"."}

Yet, there’s no escaping what it is, and what it is ... is silly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The best thing to say for the film, and this is no small thing, is that “Insurgent” moves the story forward significantly. Even “The Two Towers,” in Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, suffered from middle-book-itis, a condition in which a story neither begins nor ends and thus leaves audiences unsatisfied. But “Insurgent” lands with a real sense of completion, with one grand movement concluded and another about to begin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That dystopian visions of the future keep turning up onscreen these days probably says something about how people feel about the present, but the “Divergent” series seems less like a futuristic nightmare than a metaphor for high school. The central idea is that, 200 years from now, in the blasted-out ruin of Chicago — at least they left New York alone for once — humanity has devised a rigid but functional way to keep the peace. It divides human beings into five groups, based on personality type, and each group lives in a separate enclave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The groups are Erudite (intellectuals), Abnegation (selfless individuals), Dauntless (warriors), Amity (peace lovers) and Candor (honest people). People who are Divergent have elements of all types and are considered dangerous. Others who fail to pass entrance training for one of the factions are the Factionless, who live miserable lives of poverty and violence and are led by Naomi Watts, whose role is a major plot point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a high school metaphor, this makes some kind of sense, the notion that there are jocks and nerds and hippies and people into student government but that some of the most promising kids don’t fit in anywhere. But to extrapolate from this some grand vision of a future society is absurd on its face. For one thing, dividing people into self-contained factions is a recipe for conflict, not cooperation. Furthermore, the idea that people with similar personalities will get along harmoniously contradicts what we all know. People with similar personalities often bang heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, nobody is one thing. Everybody is “divergent,” so the idea, repeated again and again, that divergent people are a special breed is a little ridiculous. In fact, just about everything in “Insurgent” is ridiculous, and the more the movie expands to show how the Candor people live and how the hippie-dippy Amity dwellers get along, the harder it is to keep from groaning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Faced with this, the actors and filmmakers do the one thing they can do. They commit to this world vision with religious intensity. “Insurgent” begins where “Divergent” left off. Tris (Shailene Woodley), her handsome boyfriend and fellow warrior, Four (Theo James), and a group of their associates are on the run from the power-mad Erudite ruler (Kate Winslet), who wants to restore order by killing all the Divergents. But Tris wants to do more than survive. She wants to lead the revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you want to make a million dollars, write a teen novel in which a seemingly unremarkable teenage girl becomes the romantic obsession of an insanely handsome young man. (If you want to make a billion dollars, give her two insanely handsome young men, as in the “Twilight” series.) Like Bella, Tris is just awesome, but at least Woodley makes you half believe it, with her unclouded aura. Looking at her is like looking into clear water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of the screen time in “Insurgent” is taken up with politics, the efforts of Tris and Four to forge alliances and launch a coup, but this makes for flat viewing. The world of the film is so far-fetched that the mechanics of its functioning are of no interest. What’s worse, the behavior of the characters often goes against the movie’s own internal logic, which is flimsy to begin with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Schwentke brings a kind of brain-dead intensity to the calmer scenes, a passionate fervor that admits no variety of humor, except the unintentional. But he does much better in the big virtual sequences, in which we see what Tris imagines as she is hooked up to a simulator. These are the best scenes in the movie, its one claim to, if not originality, idiosyncrasy, and it really helps “Insurgent” that the climactic sequence leans heavily in this virtual direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Insurgent” would be a much worse movie if the good parts were all at the beginning. But they are saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, “Well, that was OK,” even though most of it wasn’t.

What's happened with \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent\" is less drastic but similar: A successful series has kept its cast but been revamped in the middle of its run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That run began with \"Divergent,\" director Neil Burger's respectful but tepid version of the first book in Veronica Roth's hugely successful YA trilogy about a dystopian future where only teenagers in love have the moxie to challenge the establishment and reconstitute the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Returning for the second film are Shailene Woodley and Theo James, expertly cast as Tris and Four, the trilogy's indispensable couple. But director Burger has been replaced by Robert Schwentke, and he has changed almost everything else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gone are \"Divergent's\" pair of screenwriters, who stuck closely to the original book. In their place, a new trio (Brian Duffield, Akiva Goldsman, Mark Bomback) has done serious surgery to \"Insurgent,\" streamlining the story line, changing key plot points, inventing critical elements and in general improving the narrative flow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though he did the romantic \"The Time Traveler's Wife,\" Schwentke is best-known for the geriatric secret agent movie \"RED,\" and he's brought with him to \"Insurgent\" the key visual members of his \"RED\" team, including cinematographer Florian Ballhaus, production designer Alex Hammond and second unit director and visual effects supervisor James Madigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Together they've made \"Insurgent\" into less of a youthful romance and more of an action-heavy science fiction story, the kind of rat-a-tat tale that used to star grown-ups before teens ruled the box office. The result — though admittedly it's a low bar to clear — is a more effective, adult-friendly film than its predecessor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In case you're new to the series, or have just plain forgotten, \"Insurgent\" is set inside a future post-apocalypse Chicago, where a new society has been formed by using personality traits to divide individuals into factions named Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. Those who fit nowhere, like our Tris, are Divergent and much feared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video Watch the trailer for \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent.\" Watch the trailer for \"The Divergent Series: Insurgent.\" SEE MORE VIDEOS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last film ended with Jeanine (Kate Winslet), the ruthless leader of Erudite, masterminding a plan to take control of society by murdering all the Abnegation individuals. Tris and her allies are blamed, and the new film opens with them on the run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group, which includes snarky Peter (Miles Teller), takes refuge with the kindly Amity folks, led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer). This faction is so genial the food servers tell everyone to \"Go with happiness,\" making the whole place seem like a very large branch of the Cafe Gratitude franchise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Haunted by nightmares and guilt-ridden about deaths she feels responsible for, Tris impulsively cuts off her hair, giving herself a Jean Seberg look in preparation for the Joan of Arc-type battles that are to come. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For though \"Insurgent\" can't quite do without its pro forma personal moments between characters (the film even includes a sex scene so chaste it wouldn't have disturbed Doris Day in her prime), its heart is not there but in its action sequences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crisply conceived of and executed by Schwentke and his team of \"RED\" veterans, these scenes are nothing if not traditional B-movie material. Tris and friends are chased through the forest by bad guys like partisans being pursued by Nazis, attack squads deftly rappel down high walls, and a brutal fight erupts on a wide-open railroad boxcar with heads dangling dangerously close to moving rails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when those familiar exploits are combined with the rejiggered aspects of \"Insurgent's\" plot, effective pulp storytelling is the surprising result. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For one thing, it turns out that Four's mother, Evelyn, kind of like Hiccup's mother Valka in \"How to Train Your Dragon 2,\" is not dead but merely gone. As played by the protean Naomi Watts, Evelyn reemerges as the leader of a powerful group of outcasts called the Factionless. Evelyn wants Jeanine dead but Four, who has issues with his mother (who doesn't in these films?), is not sure she can be trusted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, since evil never sleeps, nefarious Jeanine has plans of her own. She has come into the possession of an ancient and mysterious pentagon (not in the book), which she assumes is some kind of weapon system that will help keep her in power. The only trouble is, no one but a Divergent can figure out how to crack the code and open it up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A key part of \"Insurgent's\" plot is a disturbing series of SIMs, or simulations, that Tris has to survive. More elaborate than the ones in the book — and created by a combination of live-action stunts and post-production wizardry — they are more fun to watch than to read about, which, come to think of it, is the secret of this film's success.

{"context": "The 9am bell hasn't rung yet, but students at the Lycée Voltaire high school, in the French capital's 11th arrondissement, are already crowding around the big blue door to get out of the cold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few snowflakes fall on the latecomers. One student finishes his cigarette and puts it out a few feet away from the school entrance, before disappearing inside the doorway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even though it's technically illegal for them to do so, other students will wait until they are inside the school grounds to light up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've been able to smoke inside for a few weeks now,\" explains Anne, 18, who is in her final year of high school and smokes \"two to three cigarettes a day.\" She says it's a good thing that students are now being encouraged to smoke in designated areas inside the school grounds. \"Before, there were a lot of small groups crowded together [outside], and honestly, it was an easy target for an attack.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is one of the weirdest results of the attacks that killed 130 people in Paris last November, when terrorists targeted large gatherings to kill as many people as they could. Like many other high schools in and around Paris, the Voltaire has recently relaxed its rules on smoking, and is now allowing students to smoke in a designated area inside the school grounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lucas, also in his final year and also a smoker, nods in agreement with Anne. \"It's safer for us, after the attacks, and also it's in an open area, so it's not like it's polluting the entire school yard,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This newly introduced measure bends another rule that was introduced by the government in 1991, which bans smoking in public spaces like schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Days after the November 13 attacks, the French government sent a circular round to school principals, outlining new safety recommendations in the wake of the attacks. As part of the measures, the government authorized principals to set up \"designated areas within the schools [...] to avoid having students leave the high school between periods.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Principals asked the authorities whether the new recommendation allowed them to effectively circumvent the 1991 legislation, also known as the Évin law. The country's Directorate-General for Health said no, and today, the legal implications of lighting up in school remain foggy to say the least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a phone interview, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education alluded to \"a certain level of fear among parents, students and professors\" following the attacks. \"As a way to avoid crowds gathering outside of high schools, some principals are temporarily allowing students to smoke within the school grounds, in designated, open-air areas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's up to the principal to decide — depending on the specifics of their high school,\" she said. The spokeswoman also noted that while the ministry was \"tolerating\" the new smoking rules, it remained \"very committed to the fight against addiction and smoking.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"All this is highly regulated and will be in place for a limited period only, determined by current events,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Dr. Alain Rigaud, president of the National Association for Alcohol and Addiction Prevention, the relaxed rules could have \"devastating consequences\" on the health of French high-schoolers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smoking is \"conquering new ground\" despite the 1991 ban, Rigaud said. \"Smoking already affects close to a third of French high school students, and if the smokers are invited back into the playground, habits will be picked up,\" the doctor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"According to the testimonies we have received, there are already 30 or so high schools in the Île de France [the region around Paris] that allow smoking — that's way too many,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rigaud explained that he had shared his concerns with the government on Monday, during a meeting with Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. But authorities had failed to make any \"concrete promises,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Smoking is a major scourge, that kills one out of every two long-term smokers,\" the doctor said. \"Over the next thirty years, that's around 125,000 students from France's current high school population who will die because of smoking. That's huge compared to terror attacks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Security and surveillance around French schools has been beefed up in the wake of the attacks. In a recent issue of its propaganda magazine Dabiq, the Islamic State exhorted sympathizers to kill teachers in France, calling them \"corrupters.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several middle schools and high schools in and around Paris have been evacuated these past weeks after a series of hoax bomb threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Philippe Tournier, the principal of the Lycée Victor-Duruy high school in Paris, thinks that allowing smoking within the school grounds is \"necessary.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You have to remember that every day, throughout the entire Île-de-France, tens of thousands of high school students leave school around 10.30am [to smoke],\" he told VICE News. \"They are spectacularly easy targets.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tournier, who also serves as secretary-general for the country's school principals union SNPDEN, explained that the union had shared its concerns over student safety with the government in the wake of the attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were heard but there is still a coordination issue between the ministries of the interior, education and health,\" he said. \"There's a misunderstanding at the state level.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked about potential initiatives to help students kick their habit — which organizations like Rigaud's have requested — Tournier was less than hopeful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That would imply huge reforms, because I'm not sure how you can fight smoking when you have one nurse for every 300 students,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Furthermore, in the case of some of the high school students, we have no right to stop them, and if they want to smoke outside they'll do it anyway.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additional reporting by Pierre Longeray.

He is studying sciences, wants to be an estate agent and finds school OK. But he always nips out at lunchtime for a puff. “It’s just the one cigarette. I’ve smoked since I was 16,” he says, taking a drag. “I like getting out of school to get some air. But, amazingly, these days the teachers would have allowed me to just light up a cigarette in the school courtyard.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A floppy-fringed boy in an anorak agrees. His mum doesn’t know he smokes, so he didn’t want to give his name. But at 15 – still three years off France’s legal smoking age of 18 – he is delighted he is now able to have his 10am, midday and 3pm smokes in the school playground with school ashtray provided, rather than have to rush off the premises for a sneaky puff. “Staying in school to smoke saves so much time. You don’t have to run out of the school gate, then run back in to find your next lesson. It’s more practical and less stressful,” he says, exhaling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pupils suddenly being allowed to smoke inside high schools must be one of the weirdest side-effects of France’s current state of emergency. It has been four months since November’s terrorist attacks on Paris killed 130 people. But France is still living under a nationwide state of emergency made up of a raft of special powers that hark back to the Algerian war in the 1950s. The emergency measures – which have allowed police to conduct thousands of searches without a warrant or judicial oversight and place at least 290 people under house arrest outside the normal legal process – have sparked criticism from lawyers and United Nations experts. Rights groups have warned that Muslims have been unfairly targeted. There have been legal challenges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But one of France’s lesser-known special safety precautions against terror attacks is that high-school children, aged around 15 and up, are now allowed to smoke in their own school playgrounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For decades, the huge crowds of Paris high-schoolers puffing away on pavements just outside their lycée front-doors in break-time, rolling tobacco – and a few of them, let’s face it, rolling other substances – has been firmly part of the Paris landscape. Hundreds of them do it. You can find your way to Paris’s lycées by following the haze of smoke during the 10am 10-minute break between philosophy and economics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these crowds of smoking teenagers started to make the state feel uneasy. If Paris was now vulnerable to cars full of gunmen with Kalashnikovs pulling up and firing on crowds, surely the school-age smokers were an easy target? It was a grim risk that schools no longer wanted to take. Particularly after a wave of hoax bomb threats against lycées last month. France remains haunted by a fear of children being targeted in terrorist attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, despite the legal smoking age being 18 and despite smoking being officially banned in schools and workplaces, a large number headteachers, encouraged by the ministry of education, have put in special measures under the state of emergency to allow kids to smoke inside their high-school grounds – in special outdoor areas of the courtyard or playground, with ashtrays provided. The health ministry is not happy about it, and some doctors have warned of the dangers, saying perhaps more are at risk from the effects of lifelong nicotine addiction than a potential attack. But in many schools, just keeping teenagers off the pavement is seen as a precaution worth taking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The times we live in mean that the feeling of danger on the street is very great. And when you put 1,000 pupils, or more, on a pavement in a city neighbourhood, the danger is immediate for us,” justifies Christel Boury, head of the Lycée Voltaire in the east of Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was so shocked. I couldn’t believe it when they announced it,” says Léa, 17, who usually smokes at least one cigarette in her morning break, then during lunch, then at afternoon break, and then lights up as soon as she gets out of class. “Teachers have spent so long telling us smoking is bad for us and here they are giving us a special area of the school courtyard to do it in. Wow! It hasn’t made me smoke more, but for some people it probably has. Some who are really desperate manage to run down to the playground and have a super-fast smoke between classes, even if it’s not actually break-time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the biggest questions hanging over the wider state of emergency is when it will end. Once a government puts special measures in place, when can it safely say the perceived risk is over? The state of emergency has already been extended twice, and currently runs until 26 May. Public opinion largely approves. In February, when the state of emergency was extended for another three months, four out of five French people were in favour. Some people wonder whether it will be renewed again for the period of football’s European Championship in June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In schools, headteachers are pondering whether to leave the new smoking allowances in place until the end of this school year. Outside his lycée, Vincent, 15, a non-smoker, shrugs: “Straight after the attacks, we were all pretty afraid. Now you just get on with life. If a terrorist really wanted to get into our school and attack us, they’d find a way to do it anyway.”"}

A motion to dismiss a complaint grounded in fraud under Rule 9(b) for failure to plead with particularity is the functional equivalent of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1107 (9th Cir. 2003) In considering the sufficiency of a claim, the court must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56. The court must also construe the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Love v. United States, 915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir. 1988). However, the court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.

Id. at ¶¶ 45-54. Plaintiffs allege that a contract between Apple and minor existed each time that (1) Apple offered to sell game currency to a minor playing an app, (2) the minor accepted Apple’s offer, and (3) the transaction was supported by consideration, or payment made by the Plaintiffs. 1 Id. at ¶¶ 46-49. Apple argues that this issue should be dismissed as a matter of law because the relevant contractual relationship governing the in-app purchases is between Apple and Plaintiffs and is based on the original Terms & Conditions signed by Plaintiffs, thus making the individual purchases not voidable. 2 See Docket Item No. 37, at 14. Apple contends that the Terms & Conditions governs the parties’ relationships, including all subsequent purchases made using the iTunes account. However, Plaintiffs contend that the Terms & Conditions are not the contracts at issue. See Docket Item No. 44, at 14. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that the Terms & Conditions are subject to interpretation and that the court cannot dismiss the declaratory relief claim because Plaintiffs should be permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term “unauthorized use” in their contracts. 3 Apple claims that this term is not relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim or to Apple’s motion to dismiss. Id. at 14-15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple argues that there is no legal basis for inferring a contract where the alleged offer is made to one party but accepted by another party, and where the consideration is paid by the original offeree, rather than the party who accepted the alleged offer. See Docket Item No. 37, at 17. Plaintiffs contend that their complaint alleges sufficient facts to establish the existence of a contract and that, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1605, consideration for a contract can be conferred upon the promisor by any person, not only the offeree. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This court may properly consider the Terms & Conditions on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss since the document’s contents are alleged in the complaint and no party questions its authenticity, even though the document is not physically attached to the pleadings. See Rubio v. Capital One Bank, 613 F.3d 1195, 1199 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v.

The Terms & Conditions, which Plaintiffs accepted and agreed to when they opened iTunes accounts, state, “[y]ou are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account . . . .

However, Plaintiffs claim that parents may disaffirm contracts on behalf of their minor children, and in the alternative ask this court for an opportunity to cure the complaint. See Docket Item No. 44, at 16 n. 9. At this point, the court must construe the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, resolving any apparent ambiguity in their favor. See Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 421 (1969). Apple argues that Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action should be dismissed as a matter of law, and yet offers no case law to support its contention that the Terms & Conditions constitute a relational contract and that each subsequent transaction between a minor child and Defendant is governed by the terms of the relational contract. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that “a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and ‘that a recovery is remote and unlikely.’” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)). Using this standard as a guide, Defendant’s request to dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action must be denied. B. CLRA and UCL Claims i. Rule 9(b) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires that “[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.” It is established law that Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement applies to state-law causes of action. Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cal. Civ. Code § 1556 states that minors are not capable of contracting. A minor’s lack of capacity to contract affects only the ability of the other party to enforce the contract against the minor, not the minor’s ability to enforce the contract against the other party. Under Cal. Fam. Code § 6710, minors may avoid liability on contracts, subject to certain exceptions. However, only the minor, and not the other party, may disaffirm a contract. The court has found no cases in California that have decided whether a minor’s contract may be disaffirmed by someone other than the minor (such as a parent or guardian), except in the case of minor’s death.

Id. As the Ninth Circuit has previously stated: In cases where fraud is not a necessary element of a claim, a plaintiff may choose nonetheless to allege in the complaint that the defendant has engaged in fraudulent conduct. In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be “grounded in fraud” or to “sound in fraud,” and the pleading of that claim as a whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) . . . . In other cases, however, a plaintiff may choose not to allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct in support of a claim, but rather to allege some fraudulent and some non-fraudulent conduct. In such cases, only the allegations of fraud are subject to Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements.” Id. at 1103-04. When averments of fraud are made, the circumstances constituting the alleged fraud must be “specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct . . . .” 5 Vess, 317 F.3d at 1106 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such averments “must be accompanied by the who, what, where, and how of the misconduct charged.” Id. (internal quotations omitted). However, in the context of a fraudulent omission claim, a plaintiff cannot plead a specific time or place of a failure to act and may accordingly plead fraud in alternative ways. Washington v. Baenziger, 673 F. Supp. 1478, 1482 (N.D. Cal. 1987). ii. Consumers Legal Remedies Act As a preliminary matter, Apple argues that Plaintiffs’ CLRA claim is procedurally defective because of Plaintiffs’ failure to attach the required affidavit under CLRA § 1780(d) and Plaintiffs’ failure to give timely notice under CLRA § 1782(a). Plaintiffs contend that Plaintiff Meguerian filed an affidavit meeting the requirements of § 1780(d) on April 11, 2011 when Plaintiff Meguerian’s original individual complaint was filed.

Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit found that plaintiff’s claims of non-disclosure were not based in fraud. However, the court in Vess derived its elements of fraudulent misrepresentation from the California Court of Appeals case Hackenthal v. National Casualty Co., 189 Cal. App. 3d 1102 (1987) (stating the first element of a fraud claim under California law as “false representation”). The elements have since been changed by the Supreme Court of California to encompass false representation, concealment, and nondisclosure. Engalla v. Permanente Med. Group, Inc., 15 Cal. 4th 951, 974 (1997); see also Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., 567 F.3d 1120, 1126 (9th Cir. 2009). As such, claims based non-disclosure must meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). 7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Case5:11-cv-01758-EJD Document66 Filed03/31/12 Page8 of 15 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 United States District Court For the Northern District of California 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 45; Meguarian Affidavit, Docket Item No. 2. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that Plaintiff Meguerian’s CLRA demand letter satisfied the notice requirement. The CLRA states that “[i]n any action [under the CLRA], concurrently with the filing of the complaint, the plaintiff shall file an affidavit stating facts showing that the action has been commenced in a county described in this section as a proper place for the trial of the action.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1780(d). If “a plaintiff fails to file the affidavit required by this section, the court shall, upon its own motion or upon motion of any party, dismiss the action without prejudice.” Id. This court has previously dismissed CLRA claims filed in federal court where plaintiff did not file the required affidavits. In re Apple & AT&T iPad Unlimited Data Plan Litig., 802 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1077 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (dismissing CLRA claims where no plaintiff filed an affidavit). However, because Plaintiff Meguerian filed an affidavit concurrently with the original complaint which showed that the action was properly commenced in this county, the purpose of the rule has been satisfied. See In re Easysaver Rewards Litigation, 737 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1178 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (where plaintiff who had filed an affidavit along with the original complaint was no longer a named plaintiff in the consolidated complaint, the “purpose of the rule” was still satisfied). Under the CLRA, a plaintiff must also provide a company with thirty days’ notice of the specific alleged CLRA violation by certified registered mail before filing a CLRA claim for damages. Cal. Civ. Code § 1782(a). Federal courts have required “[s]trict adherence to the statute's notice provision . . . to accomplish the [CLRA's] goals of expeditious remediation before litigation.” In re Apple & AT&T, 802 F. Supp. 2d at 1077. This court has previously dismissed a CLRA claim where plaintiffs argued that the notice requirements were met by an affidavit filed by their attorneys in a previous class action case filed in state court against the same defendants. Keilholtz v. Superior Fireplace Co., 2009 WL 839076, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. March 30, 2009). Keilhotz is distinguishable from the current case, however, because the consolidated complaint at issue is not a separate action from Plaintiff Meguerian’s original complaint. When the demand letter was sent, Defendant was on notice that it was being sued by a putative class, and thus the notice was sufficient “to facilitate pre-complaint settlement,” which is the purpose of the CLRA notice requirements.

Furthermore, Plaintiff Meguerian’s original complaint sought only injunctive relief, and such a claim may be commenced without compliance with the notice requirements. Id. at *3. After thirty days have passed, the consumer may amend the complaint without leave of the court to include a request for damages. Id. Plaintiff Meguerian sent his demand letter on April 11, 2011, concurrently with filing his original complaint, and amended the complaint to include money damages after more than 60 days had elapsed. Accordingly, the notice requirement has been met. Plaintiffs allege that Apple violated the CLRA by actively marketing and promoting certain gaming apps as free or costing a nominal fee with the intent to induce minors to purchase in-app game currency. 6 See Docket Item No. 28, at ¶¶ 55-64. Plaintiffs contend that Apple breached its duty to disclose material facts about the game currency embedded in these gaming apps and the ability to purchase such game currency for a fifteen-minute period without re-entering a password. Apple contends that Plaintiffs’ CLRA claims fail to meet Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading standard. See Docket Item No. 37, at 20-21. Plaintiffs concede that Rule 9(b) applies to their CLRA claim. The CLRA proscribes “unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a); In re Actimmune Marketing Litig., 2009 WL 3740648, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2009). Conduct that is “likely to mislead a reasonable consumer” violates the CLRA. Keegan v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 2012 WL 75443, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 6, 2012) (quoting Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 135 Cal. App. 4th 663, 680 (2006)). CLRA claims sounding in fraud must establish reliance and causation. Buckland v. Threshold Enters., Ltd., 155 Cal. App. 4th 798, 809 (2007), overruled on other grounds by Kwikset Corp v. Superior Court, 51 Cal. 4th 310 (2011). Omissions are actionable under the CLRA only when the omission is contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant or where a duty to disclose exists. Keegan, 2012 WL 75443, at *6. Under California law, a duty to disclose arises in four circumstances: “(1) when NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Case No. 5:11-CV-1758 EJD ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiffs allege that Apple violated three provisions of the CLRA: (1) representing that goods have uses or characteristics they do not have, Cal.

(quoting Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 980, 987 (N.D. Cal. 2010)). In the instant case, Plaintiffs allege that Apple had a duty to disclose because it concealed and/or omitted facts in the advertising, marketing, and promotion of its apps. For a nondisclosed fact to be material, a plaintiff must show that if the omitted information had been available, the plaintiff would have been aware of it and behaved differently. Id. (quoting Oestreicher v. Alienware Corp., 544 F. Supp. 2d 964, 971 (N.D. Cal. 2008)). Contrary to Apple’s argument, Plaintiffs have alleged with specificity which misrepresentations they were exposed to, their reliance on those misrepresentations, and the resulting harm. Plaintiffs pled specific facts that Apple “actively advertis[ed], market[ed] and promot[ed] its bait Apps as ‘free’ or nominal . . . .” See Docket Item No. 28, at ¶ 72. The Complaint explicitly states that at least one Plaintiff downloaded a game app and gave it to her son “[b]ecause it said it was ‘free’” and another Plaintiff gave her iPhone to her daughter so that she could “play the ‘free’ game.” Id., at ¶¶ 9, 12. Plaintiffs further assert that they were not informed by Apple that once an iTunes account holder entered a password, he or she could make purchases for up to fifteen minutes without re-entering the password. Id. at ¶ 21. Plaintiffs contend that, “[h]ad any Plaintiff or other member of the Class known what their children were purchasing and for how much, they would not have permitted the sales transaction from being consummated.” Id. at ¶ 86. Finally, the Complaint alleges that as a result of the fraud, Plaintiffs were charged large sums of money after game currency was purchased without their knowledge. Id. at ¶¶ 8-10, 12.

Ford Motor Co., 567 F.3d 1120, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 2009); In re Facebook PPC Adver. Litig., 2010 WL 3341062, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2010). Although Plaintiffs argue that the pleading requirements of Rule 8, rather than Rule 9(b), apply to the “unfair” and “unlawful” prongs of their UCL claims because they are premised on Apple’s alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, it appears that their claims, like those in Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., are entirely dependent upon allegations that Defendant made misrepresentations and omissions that are “grounded in fraud.” Tietsworth, 2009 WL 3320489, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 13, 2009). Accordingly, those claims are subject to the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b). The UCL, California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq., prohibits acts of “unfair competition,” defined as: (1) unlawful business acts or practices; 7 (2) unfair business acts or practices; 8 (3) fraudulent business acts or practices; 9 and (4) unfair, deceptive or misleading NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the “unlawful” prong, the UCL makes violations of other laws actionable under the UCL. In re Actimmune Marketing Litig., 2009 WL 3740648, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2009). Under this prong, “it is not necessary that plaintiffs allege violation of the predicate laws with particularity; they must at a minimum, however, identify the statutory or regulatory provisions that defendants allegedly violated.” Id. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The definition of an unfair business practice in consumer cases has been unsettled since the California Supreme Court ruling in Cel–Tech, which provided a definition in the context of an antitrust case, but did not address unfairness in the consumer context. See Cel-Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tele. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163 (1999). After Cel-Tech, California appellate courts applied three different tests to determine “unfairness” in the consumer context, but the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the issue. Where the state's highest court has not decided an issue, the task of the federal court is to determine how the state high court would decide it. Dimidowich v. Bell & Howell, 803 F.2d 1473, 1482 (9th Cir. 1986). Accordingly, the federal court must look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts for guidance as to how the high court would decide. Id.; see also Lyons v. Bank of America, NA, 2011 WL 3607608 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2011). In 2006, the appellate court in Camacho v. Automobile Club of So. Calif., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1394 (2006), used the Federal Trade Commission Act as guidance for the definition of unfairness. “(1) The consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.” Id. at 1403. Several appellate courts and district courts have accepted Camacho’s test. See Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 179 Cal. App. 4th 581, 596-97 (2009); Daugherty v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 144 Cal. App. 4th 824, 839 (2006); Lyons, 2011 WL 3607608, at *10; Tietsworth v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 2009 WL 3320486 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 13, 2009). As such, this court will apply the test used in Camacho.

Actimmune, 2009 WL 3740648, at *7. Plaintiffs allege that Apple engaged in unlawful, unfair, fraudulent and/or deceptive business acts and practices in violation of the UCL by advertising, marketing, and promoting apps as free or at a nominal cost with the intent to lure minors to purchase game currency. See Docket Item No. 28, at ¶¶ 65-79. Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that the Class has suffered substantial actual economic harm. As discussed supra, for claims based on fraudulent conduct, where Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading standard applies, the court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled specific facts to support their claims. Under the “unlawful” prong, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Apple violated the CLRA. This violation is independently actionable under the UCL. Under the test for “unfair” business practices, “[a]n act or practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial, is not outweighed by any countervailing benefit to consumers or to competition, and is not an injury the consumers themselves could reasonably have avoided.” Tietsworth, 2009 WL 3320486, at *7 (quoting Daugherty v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 144 Cal. App. 4th 824 (2006)). Plaintiffs have shown that they suffered substantial harm by incurring charges that they did not explicitly authorize, ranging from $99 to $338.72 at a time. Plaintiffs contend that no benefit existed and Apple does not claim that there was any benefit to consumers or competition. Plaintiffs also contend that they could not have avoided this harm because they NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In In re Tobacco II cases, 46 Cal.4th 298 (2009), the California Supreme Court held that for a fraudulent business practices claim, section 17204 of the UCL mandates that plaintiff demonstrate “actual reliance” upon the defendant’s misrepresentation or omission. Actimmune, 2009 WL 3740648, at *8. Reliance can be demonstrated by showing that but-for defendant’s conduct, plaintiff would not, in all reasonable probability, have engaged in the injury-producing conduct. Id. Plaintiffs must allege with specificity that defendant’s alleged misrepresentations: (1) were relied upon by the named plaintiffs; (2) were material; (3) influenced the named plaintiffs’ decision to purchase the product; and (4) were likely to deceive members of the public. Tietsworth, 2009 WL 3320486, at *8. To state a claim for fraudulent marketing or advertising, “a plaintiff need merely allege that ‘members of the public are likely to be deceived’ by defendants’ conduct.” Actimmune, 2009 WL 3740648, at *7 (quoting Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Food Corp., 35 Cal. 3d 197, 211 (1983)). This is a distinct standard from common law fraud, where deception must be actually false.

Tietsworth, 2009 WL 3320486, at *8. Following other California courts and federal courts applying California law, the sufficiency of a plaintiff’s UCL fraud claim may be analyzed together with the CLRA claim. Kowalsky v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 2011 WL 3501715 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2011). As discussed in the analysis of Plaintiffs’ Second Cause of Action, Plaintiffs have pled specific facts to support their claim. Accordingly, drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs’ favor, the court denies Apple’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Third Cause of Action. C. Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Plaintiffs allege that Apple breached its contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing with Plaintiffs and class. 11 See Docket Item No. 28, at ¶¶ 80-88. Apple argues that Plaintiffs’ claim fails as a matter of law because under California law the implied covenant cannot be used to negate an express contractual provision. See Docket Item No. 37, at 10-12. Apple further argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged any express provision of their contract that relates to their claim, and an implied covenant claim untethered to an express provision fails as a matter of law. It has long been recognized in California that every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will injure the right of the other party to receive the benefits of the agreement. Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures & Tel., 162 Cal. App. 4th 1107, 1120 (2008) (quoting Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 23 Cal. 4th 390, 400 (2000)). The covenant protects the express covenants or promises of the contract. Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc., 2 Cal. 4th 342, 373 (1992). As such, the implied NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiffs argue that, in the alternative, this claim should survive at least with respect to allegations concerning the fifteen-minute window during which users could make an in-app purchase without re-entering the password.

However, “breach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite [for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing].” Id. at 373. To establish a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Plaintiffs must show that Apple lacked subjective good faith in the validity of its act or the act was intended to and did frustrate the common purpose of the agreement. Id. at 372. The Terms & Conditions signed by Plaintiffs expressly provide that Plaintiffs are responsible for activity occurring on or through their accounts and Apple may charge them for any such activity. Thus, the implied covenant cannot negate Apple’s ability to charge Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have failed to show how Apple’s act breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, the claim for breach of the implied covenant is dismissed with leave to amend. D. Restitution / Unjust Enrichment / Money Had and Received Plaintiffs claim that Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to recover from Apple all amounts wrongfully collected and improperly retained by Apple, plus interest. Apple alleges that no such independent claim exists in California. There is a split between federal courts regarding the viability of unjust enrichment as an independent claim. This court has recognized that a claim for unjust enrichment exists under California law when there is no contractual relationship between the parties. See Sanders v. Apple, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 2d 978, 989 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (“To plead a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must allege a receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another”); Blennis v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 2008 WL 818526, at *4. (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2008) (“[a] plaintiff can recover for unjust enrichment only where there is no contractual relationship between the parties . . . .

Carma, 2 Cal. 4th 342. 14 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 12 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Case No. 5:11-CV-1758 EJD ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Case5:11-cv-01758-EJD Document66 Filed03/31/12 Page15 of 15 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 United States District Court For the Northern District of California 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR alternative”). However, as reiterated by this court, a party may state as many different claims as the party has, regardless of consistency. Blennis, 2008 WL 818526, at *4. Therefore, the court will not dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment. Money had and received is also a recognized cause of action. California courts held that when a common count is used as an alternative claim seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action based on the same facts, the common count may be dismissed if the cause of action is dismissed. McBride v. Boughton, 123 Cal. App. 4th 379, 394–95 (2004). Because the court has not dismissed Plaintiffs’ first, second, and third causes of action, it need not dismiss the claim for money had and received. See 3W s.a.m. tout bois v. Rocklin Forest Products, Inc., 2011 WL 489735 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2011). Accordingly, the court does not dismiss Plaintiffs’ Fifth Cause of Action. VI.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Every year, the Earth passes through a stream left by Comet Encke, producing the Taurid Meteor Shower,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Dave Samuhel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shower is notorious for producing fireballs, and there are signs that this could be a year of enhanced activity,\" Samuhel added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fireballs are extremely bright meteors that last for several seconds and can light up an entire countryside when they are at their brightest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike other meteor showers throughout the year, the peak of the Taurid shower is drawn out, lasting nearly a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This year, the peak is expected to occur from Nov. 5 through Nov. 12, but some meteors from the Taurids will continue through the end of the month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The long peak of the shower means that stargazers will have several opportunities to see the Taurids, and one cloudy night should not prevent people from catching the display. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Usually the shower only produces 5-10 meteors per hour,\" Samuhel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AccuWeather Astronomy Facebook Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AccuWeather Astronomy Blog NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Current Cloud Cover NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The best time for viewing the Taurids may prove to be near the end of the shower's peak during the new moon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new moon will mean that the sky will be darker, making the Taurids appear even brighter as they glide across the night sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for when to look for the Taurids, there is no specific time of night that will bring more shooting stars than another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whenever it is dark, you'll have the chance to see some fireballs flash as they streak through the night sky.

(Photo: Peter Komka, EPA) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you see fireballs streaking across the night sky this week, don't panic: It's just the annual visit from the Taurid meteor shower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Taurids are not known for their high numbers, rather they are known more for the fireballs they produce,\" the American Meteor Society said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fireballs are just extremely bright meteors, Space.com's Joe Rao added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taurid shower generally shoots about two to 10 meteors across the sky per hour, the society said. Though the meteors can be seen anytime in late October through November, this year's peak will be Nov. 5-12. They will be visible in North America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This will be a good year for the Taurids, as there won't be a full moon to brighten the sky and disrupt the view, Rao said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The annual Taurid meteor shower is going on right now, and we are seeing steady activity in our meteor cameras,\" said Bill Cooke, head of the NASA Meteoroid Environments Office. \"Individuals should not be surprised if they see a bright meteor or fireball over the next few nights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are actually two branches of this shower: the South Taurids and North Taurids. Both showers will appear to come from near the Taurus the Bull constellation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Taurids can be seen north of the constellation, with the opposite being true for the South Taurids, the Science Alert website said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The best time to look for Taurids is after midnight, when Taurus is high in the sky, and when the sky is dark and clear, with no moonlight to mask the fainter meteors, NASA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taurid meteor shower is the result of tiny bits of dust and ice debris left behind by the comet Encke that's orbiting the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Earth passes through this trail of cosmic debris, the particles (which are moving at 65,000 mph) burn up in the atmosphere, creating the fiery trails called meteors, shooting stars or falling stars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There will be another chance later this month to see bright streaks in the sky when the Leonid meteor shower also kicks in. The much stronger Leonid shower is expected to peak around Nov. 17. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MtulvN ||||| Meteors, popularly called \"shooting stars,\" are much more common than most people think. In fact, there's a display going on now - courtesy of two Taurid meteor showers - if you know when and where to look. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meteor showers are made up of brief-lived streaks of light caused by small particles traversing the Earth's atmosphere and heating it to incandescence. In space these particles are called \"meteoroids.\" If they survive their trip through the atmosphere to reach the surface of the Earth, they are called \"meteorites.\" It is only while they are in transit through the air that they are called \"meteors.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most meteoroids are quite small, from the size of a pebble down to the size of a grain of sand. They are found throughout the solar system, so the Earth encounters many of them every day. It is estimated that the Earth sweeps up 15,000 tons of meteoroids each year, or 40 tons each day. [How Meteor Showers Work (Infographic)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result is that on any dark clear moonless night of the year, if you go out after midnight and let your eyes acclimatize to the dark, you are almost guaranteed to see at least a few meteors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At various times during the year, the Earth passes through parts of its orbit which are richer in meteoroids. Because these are parts of streams of material, usually left over from past comets, the dates of these showers of meteors are easily predicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At present, and for the next two weeks, we are passing through a stream of meteoroids derived from Comet Encke, or possibly a much older larger comet which spawned both Encke and the meteoroids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because these meteor streams lie along an elliptical orbit around the sun, when we watch them they appear to come from a particular part of the sky, in this case the constellation Taurus, and hence are named the Taurids. The point in the sky that they radiate from is called the \"radiant.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taurids are a particularly large collection of meteoroids, so the Earth takes several weeks to pass through them. They are also made up of unusually large particles, so while they are relatively few in number on a given night, they cause a disproportionate number of very bright meteors, which astronomers call \"fireballs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the Taurids last for several weeks, they have been divided into two separate showers because their radiant moves during that time. The \"South Taurids\" peak on Thursday (Nov. 5), and the \"North Taurids\" peak a week later on Thursday (Nov. 12). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While more meteors are usually seen after midnight, when Earth's facing edge is heading into the meteor streams, Taurids can be seen at any time of night because their radiant is high overhead most of the night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As you can see in the chart, the South Taurids appear to radiate from a point in southern Taurus, close to Omicron and Xi Tauri. The North Taurids radiate from close to the Pleiades, the brightest star cluster in the night sky. The meteors themselves can be seen anywhere in the sky, and it is only by tracing their motion backwards that you can determine which type of Taurid they are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As always, if you do go out to look for Taurids, dress warmly, and lie back comfortably on a deck chair or something similar. Have patience, because these meteors are not frequent, but when they come, they are often spectacularly bright, and often leave smoke trails behind them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you want to try to photograph them, leave your camera's shutter open for at least 30 seconds at a time, and make many exposures. Most will be blanks, but you may get lucky and capture a Taurid or two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Editor's note: If you capture a photo of a Taurid meteor that you'd like to share with Space.com and its news partners for a possible story or gallery, send images and comments in to managing editor Tariq Malik at spacephotos@space.com. ||||| Excited about cooler temperatures and fall activities? Be sure to save some of that outdoor enthusiasm for the night sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Nov. 12 and 13, the annual Taurid meteor shower will peak for the second time this month for sky watchers in North America. Unlike other celestial fireworks from recurring showers like the Perseids or Leonids, the Taurids aren't so famous for their frequency as they are for the extremely bright fireballs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dust from the Taurids, which originate from debris left behind by Comet Encke, hits the Earth’s atmosphere at 65,000 miles per hour and burns up, creating the Taurid meteor shower, according to NASA. Most years the shower is weak, and only a few Taurid meteors can be seen each night. However, there's no full moon to disrupt viewing, so there's a chance of catching a glimpse of a few fireballs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where and when to look NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A sky map showing the location of the north and south Taurids. (Photo: Star Chart/Twitter) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taurids include two streams of meteors that broke off from Comet Encke in separate events. The south Taurid peaked from Nov. 4 to 5, while the north peaks from Nov. 12 to 13. This one-two punch is what creates such a prolonged window to catch the shower in action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like other night sky events, it's best to seek out a dark location far away from light pollution and with an unobstructed view of the heavens. Look towards the constellation Taurus after it has risen above the horizon. Astronomers recommend waiting until after midnight, but you'll likely catch some fireballs with a little patience anytime after the sun has fully set. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Great balls of fire NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some years, Jupiter's gravity nudges the shower toward Earth, making more meteors visible. Astronomers call this an \"outburst,\" and that isn't expected to happen this year, as Space.com reports. However, the latest predictions forecast an outburst in 2019, NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke told Space.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What makes the Taurids produce a greater stream of large fireballs compared to other meteor showers? One theory is that Comet Encke is a piece of what was once a \"super-comet\" that broke up in our solar system some 20,000-30,000 years ago. The remains of this super comet (with average sizes ranging from pebbles to small stones) may account for the larger-than-normal fireballs that accompany the Taurids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite their appearance blazing high above, Cooke revealed in a Reddit AMA that we've nothing to fear from these celestial fireworks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The odds of a Taurid making it to the ground are small, but if one did make it, it would likely weigh less than a couple of kilograms,\" he wrote. \"The damage caused by this would be very small (broken car window, etc.). Most people think meteorites are these smoking-hot rocks in the middle of a crater, when the truth is the exact opposite. By the time a meteorite hits ground, it is cool enough to handle, and unless it is really big, there is no crater produced.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So bundle up, lay down on your back and take in one of the best meteor showers of the year. You're bound to see something spectacular fly across the night sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Editor's note: This story has been updated since it was originally published in November 2015.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those three birds were found about a mile away from where the first eagle was discovered, in Piney Neck, a small peninsula on the western edge of the Indian River Bay, east of Dagsboro.

{"context": "Lawsuit reveals teen was groomed as personal sex slave in the Duggar family’s movement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Travis Gettys NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday, April 15, 2014 15:57 EDT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leading advocate of the patriarchal Quiverfull movement groomed a teenage girl as his “personal sex object” and then used the purity culture to shame her into silence, according to a lawsuit filed by his victim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Douglas Phillips resigned last year from Vision Forum and Vision Forum Ministries over what he described at the time as an extramarital affair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the lawsuit, reported by Right Wing Watch, revealed more details about this relationship and the ways that women are treated in the Quiverfull movement – which has been popularized by the prolific Duggar family and their TLC reality show, 19 Kids and Counting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys claim Phillips, a close friend to the Duggar family and an associate of actor Kirk Cameron, “methodically groomed” Lourdes Torres since she was 15 years old and led her to believe they would be married. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phillips told the girl this was possible because his wife, Beall Phillips, “was going to die soon.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Torres appeared in two Vision Forum films, “Alone But Not Alone” and the anti-feminist documentary “Return of the Daughters.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right Wing Watch also noted that when Torres graduated from high school in 2003, Phillips wrote a blog post commending her parents for “bringing their daughter into mature Christian womanhood.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But at the same time, according to the lawsuit, Phillips indoctrinated Torres with the “patriarchal mindset” and “subtly began to manipulate Ms. Torres, so that he could use her for his sexual gratification.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit claims Phillips repeatedly groped and touched Torres inappropriately and masturbated on her, “against her wishes and over her objections,” over a period of years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While Ms. Torres would have felt compelled to submit to Douglas Phillips, the purity culture would have meant at the same time, her submission made her ‘damaged goods’ in her eyes, the eyes of her family, and her community — raising the cost for her to come forward to call him to account,” the suit claims. “She was, in fact, in a ‘no-win’ situation.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit claims that Phillips told Torres he loved her and intended to marry her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also assured her that he had done nothing wrong, and their sexual encounters were not wrong, the suit claims, but he also said that if their relationship was indeed wrong, “it was completely her fault.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit claims Phillips used his training as a lawyer to create an unregulated community that operated outside the rest of society, which allows church leaders to impose “absolute control” over the group’s women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Phillips was the dominant authority figure in Ms. Torres’s life and family,” the suit claims. “He made himself her spiritual father. He was her authority figure with regard to where she lived, where she worked, where and how she worshipped, her education, her interpersonal relationships, her time and schedule, and even acted as her counselor.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In other words, Phillips was the pastor of her church, her boss, her landlord, and the controller of all aspects of her life,” the suit adds. “Obedience to Phillips was as obedience to God in this total institution.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys for Torres said the board of Vision Forum was told of Phillips’ misdeeds but kept him in the group’s highest position of leadership until his behavior became public knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This move is consistent with the ideals and beliefs of the patriarchal movement: that women exist solely for the control and pleasure of the men,” the suit claims.

Paul Ryan blasts Boehner over budget deal 'I think the process stinks,' Ryan says of the secretive talks that produced the tentative budget and debt ceiling agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Paul Ryan on Tuesday blasted Speaker John Boehner, Senate leadership and the White House for the secretive process they used to negotiate a two-year budget and debt ceiling agreement that appears poised to pass Congress this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think the process stinks,\" said Ryan, who is expected to be elected speaker on Thursday. The Wisconsin Republican added that he hadn't gone through the details of the agreement, which was released Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not the way to do the people's business,\" Ryan said. \"And under new management we are not going to do the people's business this way. We are up against a deadline — that's unfortunate. But going forward we can't do the people's business (this way). As a conference we should've been meeting months ago to discuss these things to have a unified strategy going forward.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan has promised major changes to the legislative process as speaker in response to complaints from conservatives. They say Boehner's style has been too top-down and crisis-driven, largely ignoring the input of committees and rank-and-file members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan has been an ally of Boehner's throughout the Ohio Republican's five years as speaker. Ryan's remarks criticizing how the deal came to fruition represent his starkest public split with the man he's set to replace as Republican leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner said he wasn't a fan of the process himself. \"Totally agree, totally agree,\" the outgoing speaker said in response to Ryan's criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parroting Ryan's own terminology, Boehner added, \"It stinks. This is not the way to run a railroad.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, Boehner defended the substance of the deal, which would stave off the dual threat of a debt default and a government shutdown for more than a year. The 144-page agreement would boost spending by $80 billion over two years — split between defense and non-defense programs — and save hundreds of billions of dollars through changes to entitlement programs, including Social Security disability insurance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The measure would also forestall a large increase in Medicare premiums for some beneficiaries that was set to kick in in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal government risks a first-ever default if its borrowing authority wasn't extended by Nov. 3. A little more than a month later, government funding is set to expire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pact has broad backing in Congress among both parties, and the White House has signed off as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some conservatives have objected to the fact that rank-and-file members were not included in the talks, as well as to aspects of the deal, but they don't appear to have the votes to stop it from passing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While it certainly is not the process I would like, remember what the alternative was. The alternative was a clean debt ceiling (bill) or default on our debt .. (and when) we got to Dec. 11, we would be facing another government shutdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So when you look at the alternative, it starts to look a whole lot better. But I would hope that the process in the future would have a little more length to it and involve more members,\" Boehner concluded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan, the likely next speaker, has not said how he'll vote on the accord, which is expected on the House floor Wednesday. The deal, however, helps Ryan immensely. It sets budget levels for two years, lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017 and removes the threat of a government shutdown until October 2016. Ryan did not negotiate the deal, and wants to put some space between himself and the accord. Many Republicans are expected to vote against it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House Republican Conference will vote on Ryan's candidacy for speaker Wednesday and the full House will vote on the next speaker Thursday. ||||| Outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed optimism about a pending bipartisan agreement on the federal budget at a news conference Oct. 27. (AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional leaders worked late into the night on Tuesday to resolve last-minute issues with the bipartisan budget agreement reached between Congressional leaders and the White House, paving the way for the House to vote as early as Wednesday on the legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deal hit a snag Tuesday night after many Republicans raised questions about whether the $80 billion in spending increases in the legislation would be fully offset by spending cuts and other revenue. Conservatives continued to fight the bill throughout the night, including attempting to kill the bill in a late-night hearing of the House Rules Committee. But Republican leaders worked out last-minute fixes and the committee voted to clear the bill, setting up a possible Wednesday floor vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some Republicans raised concerns that the bill only includes about $75.7 billion in spending cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office, about $4 billion short of the $80 billion in spending increases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional leaders amended the deal late Tuesday to resolve the discrepancy. Boehner spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said the amendment included a “technical fix” to off-budget money, known as the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, that was used to help offset some spending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “With this amendment, all budget cap relief is fully offset with mandatory spending cuts and other savings,” Schillinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the amendment did not resolve additional concerns about the deal and it is unclear how much support there will be for the deal among Republicans. Conservative members testified before the committee that they were angry with both the substance of the agreement and fact that it was negotiated in secret by outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who is expected to step down later this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawmakers are considering outgoing House Speaker John Boehner's plan to avert another government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. Here's what you need to know about it. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It don’t feel right to me that we let the guy that’s leaving office do a budget that the rest of us have to live with, and we don’t even know where the new guy coming in stands on it,” said Rep. Curt Clawson (R-Fla.) during the late-night Rules meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner’s likely successor, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), is said to have not been involved in the negotiations. In fact, Ryan strongly condemned the way the deal was assembled, explaining that he had yet to actually lay eyes on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “About the process, I can say this: I think the process stinks,” Ryan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan added that “under new management,” the “people’s business” would be conducted differently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leaders were forced to combat a long list of sticking points on Tuesday, including anger from members who opposed a reduction in crop insurance payments, which would raise $3 billion over 10 years. The top members of the House and Senate agriculture committees released a statement on Tuesday opposing it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Make no mistake, this is not about saving money. It is about eliminating Federal Crop Insurance,” said House Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.). “The House Agriculture Committee was not consulted regarding any changes to policies under the jurisdiction of our committee.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others were upset that Boehner negotiated the deal in secret with the White House, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). The small group kept a tight lid on the negotiations, revealing the deal only once it was complete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier in the day, Boehner conceded the deal was crafted before his departure because he didn’t want the new speaker “to walk into a dirty barn full of you know what.” He agreed that the package should have been assembled in a more inclusive way, saying, “This is not the way to run a railroad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner presented the budget deal to his Republican colleagues at a private meeting Tuesday morning, outlining his plan to avert another government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling as a parting gift to his successor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deal would increase federal spending by $80 billion over two years and raise the federal borrowing limit through 2017. The 144-page bill, which was released Monday shortly before midnight, was welcomed by Democrats who have been pushing for budget negotiations all year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have a budget agreement,” Boehner (R-Ohio) said after the meeting of House Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner, who will step down on Friday, added that the alternative was a clean debt-ceiling suspension with no extra funding for troops. “This is a good deal,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Congressional leaders, White House reach two-year budget deal] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats largely embraced the plan. Vice President Biden praised the deal Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The last seven years, we’ve gone from crisis to recovery, and we’re on the verge of being able to have a genuine economic resurgence here,” Biden said. “And what we’ve put together is a good deal. No one got everything they wanted. But it will last for two years and it will prevent us from lurching from crisis to crisis.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that the agreement reaches the issues that were important to Republicans, including more money for defense programs and offsetting funding increases through spending cuts rather than tax increases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m hopeful and optimistic that that bill will come over to the Senate, and when it does, we’ll take it up,” McConnell said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early indications are that key Senate Republicans are also on-board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he will support the budget deal because “it restores all but $5 billion of the defense requirements.” He said that if the budget agreement passes he could move quickly to adjust and pass the National Defense Authorization Act that was recently vetoed by President Obama over budget concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCain’s backing all but ensures the support of other defense hawks, including Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), a GOP presidential candidate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re in a box here,” Graham said. “But if Senator McCain is okay with it, then I’ll probably be okay with it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post’s new political tipsheet] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the meeting Tuesday morning, some conservatives complained that the negotiations were conducted without the input of committee chairs and rank-and-file members. But they’re unlikely to have the numbers to derail the pact as long as Democrats and moderate Republicans stay onboard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t know if this thing could pass,” said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “It could break apart, and we could begin tackling this piecemeal well into Paul Ryan’s speakership.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Centrists such as Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said that the deal isn’t perfect but that it prevents default and gives certainty to the military while making long-term reforms to Social Security and Medicare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think it’s a pretty easy choice to make,” Cole said. “It’s a compromise and that means we had to give some things up that we don’t want, but we got some great things.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pelosi embraced the agreement Tuesday morning, signaling that the 188 House Democrats could provide a large portion of the vote needed to get a majority in the House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The bipartisan budget package unveiled last night represents real progress for hard-working families across the country,” Pelosi said. “I look forward to working toward House passage of this proposal this week. Next, we must move forward to complete the appropriations for FY2016 and keep government open.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Pelosi and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) can deliver votes from most, if not all, of their members, Boehner will have to win the support of only about 40 to 50 Republicans to pass the deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would also take the pressure off Ryan. Conservatives will be closely watching whether Ryan supports the deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I hope Paul Ryan will let us know how he feels about the process,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said Monday after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Can Paul Ryan disarm the Freedom Caucus?] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials also weighed in to back the proposal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The agreement reached by congressional leaders last night meets these key tests: It provides substantial relief from harmful spending cuts, and it does so equally on the defense and non-defense sides of the budget,” one White House official said in an e-mail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deal isn’t a complete victory for Democrats, who were pushing for even more spending increases and hoped to pass an increase in the federal borrowing limit without including it in a broader budget deal. Obama has insisted that the debt limit not be used as a negotiating tool for spending cuts. The deal allows Obama to say he secured a bargain on a scale that has not been seen since the 2013 agreement between Ryan and the Senate Budget Committee’s then-chairman, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats still get to celebrate a messaging victory and will probably take credit for the deal. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a member of leadership, pointed out that the proposal is the kind of spending agreement he and other Democrats have been promoting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For months, we Democrats have asked for a budget that increases spending significantly above sequester levels and does so in a way that is equally balanced between defense and key middle-class programs,” Schumer said. “This agreement does both.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agreement includes about $80 billion in spending increases over two years, divided equally between defense and domestic programs, with $50 billion in new spending in the first year and $30 billion in the second. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those increases would be paid for with savings from changes to the Social Security Disability Insurance fund and Medicare payments to doctors and other health-care providers. New revenue would be raised by auctioning off portions of the government-owned broadcast spectrum, selling oil from the strategic oil reserve and cracking down on audits of large business partnerships. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also includes an additional $16 billion over two years from off-budget spending increases from the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. That portion would not need to be offset, but Democrats previously opposed using the money for defense-only spending. In addition, a premium increase for Medicare Part B recipients would be prevented from going into effect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane contributed to this report."}

Flake on Menendez & immigration effort NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: Can Robert Menendez survive?) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After initially appearing stunned and paralyzed by the latest developments — Menendez ran away from reporters at a Garden State delegation event on Friday — the New Jersey Democrat is starting to fight back. He’s waging a public and private campaign to clear his name, including giving an interview to a national TV network and some New Jersey reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one key move, Menendez has begun to rely on trusted aides and former advisers for guidance, including one who is very close to Attorney General Eric Holder. Menendez’s campaign has hired Matt Miller, a former top spokesman for the Justice Department — which is investigating a campaign donor caught up in the scandal — under Holder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Bob Menendez has been a friend and a mentor for years,” Miller said. “And like a lot of people, I want to do anything I can to help fight these ridiculous smears.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez initially tried to dismiss allegations in November by The Daily Caller that he had sex with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic following several trips to the Caribbean island on the private jet of a friend and big donor, Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Jersey Democrat vehemently dismissed the reports as false and a “smear job” by a conservative publication, as the first story ran on Nov. 1, just days before his reelection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the story gained traction last week when the FBI and investigators from the Department of Health and Human Services raided Melgen’s office in West Palm Beach, Fla. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the story first broke, Menendez has repaid $58,500 for the cost of two 2010 flights on Melgen’s jet to the Dominican Republic, claiming his failure to do so was simply an “administrative mistake.” Menendez clearly hopes that move will help shift the issue from a criminal case involving the Justice Department to a probe headed by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, if he has to deal with any probe at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice wouldn’t be involved in investigating a relatively minor issue like failing to disclose the flights, although the ethics panel would. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez also has quietly started to distance himself from Melgen, even though he enjoys a long personal relationship with the Florida doctor and tried to intervene on Melgen’s behalf with the State and Commerce departments in regard to a port security contract a Melgen-owned company has with the Dominican government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez allies are now privately pushing the line that the FBI raid in West Palm Beach was focused on Melgen alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miller, a respected former aide to both Menendez and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), left Justice in 2011. Miller has now been hired by Menendez’s campaign to help out on the scandal, though he would not offer details on how long or how much he will be paid or how long the assignment will be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez is already being advised by Democratic attorney Marc Elias on ethics-related issues, but it is not clear whether Menendez has hired a criminal defense attorney at this time. ||||| WASHINGTON — Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey intervened with federal health officials on two occasions in the last four years in an effort to help a close friend in a billing dispute with Medicare, federal investigators said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senator’s efforts were unavailing, but he persisted, the investigators said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senator’s friend, Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon, is under federal investigation. A team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Health and Human Services raided Dr. Melgen’s offices in West Palm Beach and removed 30 boxes of documents and other material last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation about the senator’s involvement in the Medicare matter was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, The New York Times published an article detailing the senator’s efforts to help Dr. Melgen, a major benefactor of his, revive a lucrative contract to provide port security in the Dominican Republic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Melgen has been in a dispute with Medicare officials over billing for a drug used to treat certain types of macular degeneration, which can cause loss of vision and damage to the retina. By getting several doses of the drug from a single vial, investigators said, Dr. Melgen was able to make the drug go further, and as a result, he was able to treat more patients and file more claims with Medicare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thus, for example, Medicare might allow doctors to bill $2,000 for a vial, but the doctor sometimes filed claims for as much as $8,000, said the investigators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Medicare was trying to recover money from the doctor, the senator contacted federal officials and suggested that the agency was being unfair and needed to clarify its policy, the investigators said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2009, they said, Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, called Jonathan D. Blum, a senior official at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as C.M.S. In 2012, they said, the senator expressed his concern in a meeting with Marilyn B. Tavenner, the acting administrator of the agency, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both officials indicated to Mr. Menendez that they had no plans to change the payment policy for the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government eventually recovered some of the money from Dr. Melgen, but he is exercising his right to pursue an administrative appeal, challenging Medicare’s determination that he had overbilled the program, the investigators said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An aide to Mr. Menendez issued a statement on Wednesday night, saying that the senator had no knowledge of any Medicare fraud investigation involving Dr. Melgen’s company. “Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants,” one of Mr. Melgen’s companies, the aide said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Menendez aide confirmed that the senator has “in the past raised concerns with C.M.S. about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in C.M.S. rules that are difficult for providers to understand.” Mr. Menendez wanted to make sure that “providers were not penalized if C.M.S. clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively,” the aide added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alan Reider, a lawyer representing Dr. Melgen, issued a statement Wednesday night saying that his client was cooperating fully with the government and had not been told the focus of the investigation. Because Dr. Melgen is a Medicare provider, Mr. Reider said, his claims had been subject to audits by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and he called the audits routine. “Those audits have been resolved administratively, consistent with Medicare requirements,” Mr. Reider said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The relationship between Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen has been drawing scrutiny since reports recently surfaced that Mr. Menendez had accepted two round-trip flights aboard Dr. Melgen’s jet for personal vacations in the Dominican Republic in 2010. He failed to report them as gifts or reimburse Dr. Melgen at the time, as required. Then in January, he sent the doctor a check to cover the cost of the flights, with his aides saying that he failed to reimburse the doctor earlier because of sloppy paperwork. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Menendez has been helpful to Dr. Melgen. Two years ago, Dr. Melgen bought an ownership interest in a company that had a long-dormant contract with the Dominican Republic to provide port security. Mr. Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that holds sway over the Dominican Republic, subsequently urged officials in the State and Commerce Departments to intervene so the contract would be enforced, at an estimated value of $500 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the focus of the investigation involving the raid late last month is not clear, Mr. Menendez finds himself defending his relationship with a major benefactor as he ascends to the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ||||| Sen.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has been embroiled in a controversy involving his relations with a Miami campaign contributor and the awarding of a security contract at a port in the Dominican Republic. Here is a look at the senator’s career in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Robert Menendez raised concerns with top federal health-care officials twice in recent years about their finding that a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor — had overbilled the government by $8.9 million for care at his clinic, Menendez aides said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez (D-N.J.) initially contacted federal officials in 2009 about the government’s audit of Salomon Melgen, complaining to the director overseeing Medicare payments that it was unfair to penalize the doctor because the billing rules were ambiguous, the aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, in a meeting with the acting administrator of the agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, Menendez again questioned whether federal auditors had been fair in their assessment of Melgen’s billing for eye injections to treat macular degeneration, the senator’s aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agency had ordered Melgen to repay the $8.9 million, and at the time of both conversations, Melgen was disputing the agency’s conclusion. His appeal continues to this day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez’s office provided this account of his contacts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after The Washington Post asked about the role he had played in the long-standing dispute between Melgen and the agency over his billing practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez, who became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month, is under scrutiny because of his close relationship with Melgen. The doctor donated more than $700,000 last year to Menendez’s reelection campaign and other Senate Democrats. And when Melgen needed help with a port security contract in the Dominican Republic last year, Menendez urged U.S. officials to press the country to carry out the multimillion-dollar agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Menendez is facing a Senate ethics inquiry about two free trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to the doctor’s seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had not properly disclosed the trips. He wrote a personal check for $58,500 to reimburse Melgen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, a federal investigation of what law enforcement officials say are allegations of health-care fraud by Melgen escalated last week when FBI agents and health-care investigators raided medical offices in West Palm Beach where he runs Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. The teams spent nearly 24 hours searching the premises and removing dozens of boxes containing billing and medical records and computer files. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal investigators and health-care auditors have had concerns about Melgen’s billing practices at various times over the past decade, two former federal officials said. In part, they have examined the volume of eye injections, surgeries and laser treatments performed at his West Palm Beach clinic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a Menendez aide said Wednesday that the senator did not know Melgen was under formal investigation for possible fraud until the well-publicized raid last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants,” his office said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senator’s conversation with federal officials about Melgen’s case was unrelated to the current investigation, Menendez aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “On a separate issue regarding Medicare reimbursement, he has in the past raised concerns with CMS about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in CMS rules that are difficult for providers to understand and can lead to judgments after the fact,” the statement said. “His interest was in making sure providers were not penalized if CMS clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alan Reider, Melgen’s attorney, said Wednesday that his client has returned the government money in dispute but is contesting the CMS audit finding so he can reclaim the money. Reider said Melgen believes he was following Medicare guidelines. Reider added that Melgen was not aware that his practice was under investigation until federal agents arrived at his clinic last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At issue in the reimbursement dispute is Melgen’s multiple use of individual vials for eye injections to treat macular degeneration. Federal auditors have said Melgen often billed the government three to four times for injections from a single vial, according to two federal officials and lawyers familiar with the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government’s Medicare program reimburses providers $2,000 for each vial, so Melgen was billing $6,000 to $8,000 for each vial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melgen’s attorneys said the doctor was properly billing for treating four patients with medical injections, albeit from one vial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After CMS ruled in 2008 that Melgen would have to repay the government, he and his legal representatives contacted Menendez’s office, arguing that the finding was unfair, the senator’s aides said. Menendez’s staff members had several conversations with agency officials to learn more about the billing rules and the details of Melgen’s case in particular, the aides said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In July 2009, Menendez called Jonathan Blum, the Medicare director at CMS, to express concern, the aides said. Menendez brought up Melgen’s case, they said, in the context of broader concerns about the guidelines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in June 2012, Menendez raised Melgen’s case again at a meeting with CMS Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, aides recounted. They said the primary subject of the meeting was the implementation of President Obama’s health-care overhaul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aides said Menendez never urged the CMS to take specific action on Melgen’s case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blum and Tavenner declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melgen frequently cited his connection to Menendez, according to two former federal officials and doctors in South Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When federal health-care fraud investigators were questioning him several years ago about his billing practices, he invoked the senator’s name, the former officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He used Menendez’s name all the time. He would say, “Menendez is a good friend of mine, and he knows I never did anything wrong,’ ” said a former senior federal official familiar with the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Florida, it was more threatening, several doctors in the South Florida region recounted. After one local eye surgeon criticized Melgen’s treatment methods in discussions with other Florida doctors, Melgen warned that he had important friends in the Senate, including Menendez, said two doctors familiar with the exchange. They said Melgen cautioned that his Washington friends could arrange an intensive federal audit of the surgeon’s practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reider, the attorney, said he had no knowledge of any comments Melgen may have made mentioning his friendship to Menendez. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melgen came to the attention of fraud investigators amid complaints from other local eye doctors alleging that his treatments were often unnecessary, a waste of money and sometimes harmful to patients’ eyesight, the two former federal officials and several doctors said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, investigators considered him an “outlier” compared with his peers because of the volume of his billing and the rate at which he administered eye injections and performed procedures on government-insured patients, the former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melgen “was somebody who consistently showed up on the radar and was being looked at quite a bit,” said a former senior health-care fraud investigator. “The sheer volume itself is going to keep him on the radar.’’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When federal investigators interviewed Melgen, he tried to exert pressure on them by mentioning the names of Menendez and other influential politicians, the former fraud investigator said. “We thought it was odd because Menendez was in New Jersey and this guy was in Florida,’’ the official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A second former federal official recounted that Menendez’s name came up repeatedly when Melgen was interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department and the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was using Menendez more as a character reference,” the official said. “He thought he was untouchable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal interest in Melgen stretches back 10 years, when investigators interviewed Philip Rosenfeld, a nationally known retina specialist, about the volume of treatments Melgen was performing, said several eye doctors in South Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These doctors said Rosenfeld, who pioneered the use of Avastin injections for macular degeneration to stem eyesight loss, had long been troubled by Melgen’s methods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FBI agents recently interviewed Rosenfeld again, this time two days before they raided Melgen’s clinic, the doctors said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reached at his home in Key Biscayne, Rosenfeld declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors in south Florida said that they have been fearful of criticizing Melgen publicly, and that his Washington connections may be protecting him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2010, Melgen scolded eye surgeon Randy Katz for publicly criticizing the quality of his care. According to two fellow doctors, Melgen cited his Senate connections and told Katz that he could face a Medicare investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Katz did not respond to requests for comment. Melgen’s attorney declined to discuss his client’s conversations with Katz or allegations that his client had threatened other doctors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon after the encounter, according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Post, Katz wrote to Palm Beach doctors in praise of Melgen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It has come to my attention that certain statements I made have been misunderstood as criticisms of Dr. Melgen,” Katz wrote in the open letter. “To be clear, I know Dr. Salomon Melgen to be a capable and NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR highly-skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon. . . . If you hear any suggestion that I have said otherwise, you should disregard that suggestion as being false.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Crites contributed to this report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the nation's ability to borrow money soon to lapse, Republicans and Democrats alike said the shutdown that has furloughed an estimated 800,000 federal workers could last for two weeks or more, obliging a divided government to grapple with both issues at the same time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican-controlled House approved legislation to reopen the nation's parks and the National Institutes of Health, even though many Democrats criticized them as part of a piecemeal approach that fell far short of what was needed. The bills face dim prospects in the Senate, and the White House threatened to veto both in the unlikely event they make it to Obama's desk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're trying to do is to get the government open as quickly as possible,\" said the House majority leader, Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. \"And all that it would take is us realizing we have a lot in agreement.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An attempt by Democrats to force shutdown-ending legislation to the House floor failed on a 227-197 vote, with all Republicans in opposition. That left intact the tea party-driven strategy of demanding changes to the nation's health care overhaul as the price for essential federal financing, Despite grumbling from Republican moderates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats were scathing in their criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The American people would get better government out of Monkey Island at the local zoo than we're giving them today,\" said Rep. John Dingell of Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stock market ended lower as Wall Street CEOs, Europe's central banker and traders pressed for a solution before serious damage is done to the economy. Chief executives from the nation's biggest financial firms met Obama for more than an hour Wednesday, some of them plainly frustrated with the tactics at play in Congress and with the potential showdown coming over the debt limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can re-litigate these policy issues in a political forum, but we shouldn't use threats of causing the U.S. to fail on its obligations to repay its debt as a cudgel,\" Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said after the meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican National Committee announced it would pay for personnel needed to reopen the World War II Memorial, a draw for aging veterans from around the country that is among the sites shuttered. In a statement, party chairman Reince Priebus challenged Democrats \"to join with us in keeping this memorial open.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats labeled that a stunt. \"We've already been working on a plan to open the Memorial _ and the entire government _ after the GOP caused them to close,\" said party spokesman Mo Elleithee. \"It's called a clean\" spending bill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As it turned out, more than 125 World War II veterans from Mississippi and Iowa who were initially kept out of the memorial Tuesday were escorted to the site with the help of members of Congress. Officials made further arrangements to allow veterans groups into the memorial during the shutdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A sampling of federal agencies showed how unevenly the shutdown was felt across the government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban Development listed only six percent of their employees as essential, and therefore permitted to work during the impasse. James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, said about 70 percent of civilian employees in agencies under his control had been sent home.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with CNBC before meeting with lawmakers, Obama said he would not negotiate with Republicans until the government is reopened and Congress votes to raise the debt limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we get in the habit where a few folks, an extremist wing of one party, whether it's Democrat or Republican, are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat (to) undermine the full faith and credit of the United States, then any president who comes after me, not just me, will find themselves unable to govern effectively,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The White House said Obama would have to truncate a long-planned trip to Asia, calling off the final two stops in Malaysia and the Philippines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shutdown also intruded into the race for governor of Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat, said he supported legislation to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed federal employees. The Republican contender, Ken Cuccinelli, called on members of Congress to decline their pay as long as the shutdown lasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's call to lawmakers to meet drew a quizzical response from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. A spokesman, Don Stewart, said, \"we're a little confused as to the purpose.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner was \"pleased the president finally recognized that his refusal to negotiate is indefensible,\" said his spokesman, Brendan Buck. \"It's unclear why be having this meeting if it's not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House sidetracked legislation Tuesday night to reopen some veterans programs, the national parks and a portion of the Washington, D.C., municipal government. All three bills fell short of the two-thirds majority needed when Democrats voted overwhelmingly against this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans tried again, this time under rules requiring only a simple majority. The parks measure was approved on a vote of 252-173, with 23 Democrats breaking ranks and voting in favor. The vote to reopen NIH was 254-171. The House also voted to allow the Washington, D.C., government to use the taxes it collects to operate programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Votes were deferred on more bills, one to assure pay for members of the National Guard and Reserves and another to allow some veterans programs to resume. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NIH bill was added to the day's agenda after Democrats had said seriously ill patients would be turned away from the facility's hospital of last resort, and no new enrollment permitted in experimental treatments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democratic Rep.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An earlier attempt by Republican dissidents to take control of the floor and vote alongside Democrats to reopen the government fizzled badly earlier in the week, and it was unclear whether a new attempt could gain traction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At issue is the need to pass a temporary funding bill to keep the government open since the start of the new budget year on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress has passed more than 100 temporary funding bills since the last shutdown in 1996, almost all of them without controversy. The streak was broken because conservative Republicans have held up the current measure in the longshot hope of derailing or delaying Obamacare, just as the health insurance markets at the heart of the law opened on Tuesday.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What they’re saying about the shutdown: Certain phrases repeatedly came up during speeches on the House floor on Tuesday. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fight over the government shutdown quickly moved on Wednesday to a bigger showdown over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, as the first White House talks to solve the fiscal standoff failed to make any progress toward a deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama and business leaders warned that the clash has raised the chances of a historic default on the national debt, which would occur if Congress doesn’t agree to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling later this month and could cause a new recession. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama said investors should take more seriously the threat of a potential default, which global markets have brushed off for months as Washington’s usual partisan theatrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This time, I think Wall Street should be concerned,” Obama said on CNBC. “When you have a situation in which a faction is willing to default on U.S. obligations, then we are in trouble.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Capitol Hill, senior Republicans began to suggest that a broad agreement to overhaul entitlements and the tax code could be used as a resolution to both the shutdown and debt limit clash. But Democrats view that approach as hostage taking, and say Congress must reopen the government and authorize additional borrowing before serious negotiations can occur.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the White House, Obama joined the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress in a one-and-a-half-hour meeting that Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate minority leader, called “cordial but unproductive.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leaders of both parties said afterwards that Republican demands to defund or delay Obama’s signature health law, which helped lead to this week’s shutdown, remain a critical obstacle to any agreement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the president “reiterated tonight he will not negotiate.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve got divided government. Democrats control the Senate, Republicans control the House,” he said. “All we’re asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Senate Majority Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the president was unbending, calling him “strong, strong, strong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, “One thing we made very clear in that meeting: We are locked in tight on Obamacare.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The back-and-forth Wednesday came on the second day of a partial government shutdown that has furloughed 800,000 federal workers and appears likely to remain for an extended period of time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next crucial deadline comes on Oct. 17, the last day that the Treasury Department estimates that the federal government is certain to have enough money to pay all its bills. Investors have been demanding higher interest rates for U.S. Treasury bills in recent days, a sign of concern that the federal government could have trouble servicing its debt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, there was growing realization on both sides of the aisle that lawmakers will likely have to deal with resolving the debt ceiling issue at the same time as the government shutdown. Some senior Republicans said they are ready to enter a more far-reaching discussion over entitlement programs, tax reform and the federal debt limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think we’re at a point where we need a broader solution here to not only the [temporary funding measure] but also the debt limit,” said Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “It’s right around the corner. I think they’re both going to have to get addressed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) agreed. “The president should start negotiating,” he said. “I’d like to just get one agreement” to reopen the government and raise the debt limit “and be done with it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama and Senate Democrats have so far refused to negotiate over either issue, saying they have already agreed to locking in lower funding levels favored by the GOP and that paying the nation’s bills — which raising the debt ceiling would do -- is non-negotiable. Broader budget issues can be discussed after the government reopens and the debt limit is lifted, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Once we reopen government, I propose a House-Senate joint conference to work out the nation’s long-term fiscal challenges,” Reid said. “Both sides have priorities, but we want to move forward.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The clash is starting to raise concerns in markets that the two sides will not find agreement before Oct. 17. Investors are already demanding much higher returns on U.S. Treasury bills that are paid back after that date, reflecting a higher risk assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In daily market-monitoring discussions with Wall Street firms on Wednesday, Treasury officials said there were new fears among investors that a deal might not be reached until the final hours — which would cause intense market volatility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. default, which has never happened before, would lead to a dramatic cut in federal spending and delays in Social Security checks and could undermine the traditional U.S. role as a financial safe-haven. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s precedent for a government shutdown; there is no precedent for default,” Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said Wednesday after he and several other business leaders met with Obama at the White House. “We’re the most important economy in the world. We’re the reserve currency of the world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both sides harbor hopes that the shutdown and the looming default deadline increase their political leverage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s pretty straightforward that the shutdown is hurting Republicans and weakening their standing,” a senior Democratic aide said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Republicans argue that the painful consequences of breaching the debt ceiling gives them more power to demand policy changes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This position that is being taken by the majority leader in the Senate, as well as the president, that there will be no negotiations, is not something that I think the American people would want,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While polls suggest that Republicans are likely to blamed for the shutdown, both parties took steps Wednesday to contain any potential damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans continued to press a piece-meal approach to funding the government, pursuing one-off bills that would fund the National Institutes of Health and other programs. Obama pledged to veto them, repeating his demand that Congress reopen the entire government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama took other steps to avoid attracting flak for the shutdown, including taking advantage of a loophole that would allow many veterans to visit shuttered war memorials. Obama also canceled part of a trip next week to Asia to limit the amount of time he might be abroad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And on Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties pledged to donate their congressional pay to charity during the shutdown. “I shouldn’t get a congressional salary while other federal employees are denied the ability to go to work,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reid repeated what the president has long maintained, that Democrats won’t barter over Republican-desired changes to Obamacare with the twin swords of the shutdown and a possible default on the nation’s credit hanging over their heads.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked, Reid declined to say why it took 80 minutes to conclude that no progress could be made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), in a bind on the fiscal fight because he’s in a tough reelection race, released a statement calling the meeting “cordial but unproductive” and showing solidarity with Boehner’s position that the House and Senate should open a formal dialogue on resuming government funding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While I appreciated the opportunity to speak directly with the president about this pressing issue, I was disappointed that he had little interest in negotiating a solution or in encouraging Senate Democrats to agree to the House request for a conference,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (POLITICO interview: Rep. Steve King predicts longer shutdown) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the meeting, Obama had told CNBC that he wasn’t in any mood to negotiate on what he considers to be core responsibilities of Congress and will talk about other issues once the government is open and the debt-limit increase is secured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Until we get that done,” Obama said, “we are not going to engage in a series of negotiations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vice President Joe Biden, who has been a wheeler-dealer on past budget agreements, attended the meeting but did not address reporters afterward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Oval Office session came as the federal government remains shut down for the second day, with no end in sight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers remained furloughed, and numerous government services have been temporarily ended as Obama and congressional Democrats face off against GOP leaders over the future of Obamacare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (WATCH: Veterans storm World War II Memorial) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In between the interview and the congressional meeting, the president huddled with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who has said the date for the government defaulting on its debt — absent congressional action — is Oct. 17. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Increasingly, it appears that Washington’s leaders will have to come up with a budget plan that both reopens the government and raises the debt limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans said beforehand that they welcomed the president’s invitation to the White House, as Obama, Reid and Pelosi have refused up to this point to accept anything other than a “clean” continuing resolution that funds the government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re pleased the president finally recognizes that his refusal to negotiate is indefensible,” Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement. “It’s unclear why we’d be having this meeting if it’s not meant to be a start to serious talks between the two parties.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (WATCH: Protesters interrupt GOP presser on Capitol Hill) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If there was a small sliver of optimism, it was in Reid’s recounting of a portion of the meeting. Democrats offered to talk with Boehner about a range of other issues, including health care and farming laws, if he would first pass a “clean” extension of government funding. But, Reid said, Boehner replied “no,” insisting that the two chambers try to strike an agreement on the basic spending bill. Many Republicans now think it’s in their interest to cut a much bigger deal on spending, taxes, and the debt limit, and It is not inconceivable that a deal could be worked out that would involve a two- or three-step process in which the government would be opened, the debt cap raised and a long-term budget agreement triggered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A breakaway group of more than a dozen House Republicans have indicated they would vote for a clean government spending bill — without language aimed at Obamacare — if it came to the floor. But they have so far not joined Democrats in procedural votes that would frustrate the GOP majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reps. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) and Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) are working on a bipartisan continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government for six months, which would include a repeal of the medical device tax, according to several lawmakers and aides.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested the demonstrators who had defied orders to disperse following a larger, peaceful protest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After nightfall, a small group remained and the scene turned to one of disorder, following the pattern of Friday and Saturday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers tackled some protesters who defied police orders and used pepper spray before starting the mass arrests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a late-night news conference, Mayor Lyda Krewson noted that “the vast majority of protesters are non-violent,” and blamed the trouble on “a group of agitators.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting police commissioner Lawrence O’Toole struck a hard stance, saying: “We’re in control, this is our city and we’re going to protect it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The protests in St Louis followed the acquittal on Friday of former police officer Jason Stockley, 36, of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The violence evoked memories of the riots following the 2014 shooting of a black teenager by a white officer in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police reported confiscating weapons including handguns and recovered plastic spray bottles containing an unknown chemical that hit officers, who were then decontaminated.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ST. LOUIS (AP) — Hundreds of people protesting the acquittal of a white former St. Louis police officer in the fatal shooting of black man following a high-speed chase marched for hours in mostly peaceful demonstrations, until a broken window at the mayor's home and escalating tensions led riot-gear-clad officers to lob tear gas to disperse the crowds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Activists had for weeks threatened civil disobedience if Jason Stockley were not convicted in the death of Anthony Lamar Smith, stirring fears of civil unrest and the erecting of barricades around police headquarters, the courthouse where the trial was held and other potential protest sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A racially diverse crowd of protesters — some carrying weapons, as allowed by state law, and others toting children and waving posters — took to the streets within hours of Friday's decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 20 arrests were made by early evening, and some protesters were pepper-sprayed during confrontations with authorities. St. Louis police reported that 10 officers had suffered injuries by the end of the night, including a broken jaw and dislocated shoulder, and some journalists reported being the target of threats from demonstrators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Activists said they would meet again Saturday to plan further demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stockley, who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting, had insisted he saw the 24-year-old Smith holding a gun and felt he was in imminent danger. Prosecutors said the officer planted a gun in Smith's car after the shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Stockley said he understands how video of the shooting looks bad, but that he did nothing wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I can feel for and I understand what the family is going through, and I know everyone wants someone to blame, but I'm just not the guy,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stockley, 36, requested his case be decided by a judge instead of a jury, an option open to any defendant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This court, in conscience, cannot say that the State has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense,\" St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson wrote in his decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner acknowledged the difficulty of winning police shooting cases but said prosecutors believe they proved that Stockley intended to kill Smith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assistant Circuit Attorney Robert Steele emphasized during the trial that police dashcam video of the chase captured Stockley saying he was \"going to kill this (expletive), don't you know it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Less than a minute later, the officer shot Smith five times. Stockley's lawyer dismissed the comment as \"human emotions\" uttered during a dangerous police pursuit. The judge wrote that the statement \"can be ambiguous depending on the context.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stockley, who left St. Louis' police force in 2013 and moved to Houston, could have been sentenced to up to life in prison without parole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case was among several in recent years in which a white officer killed a black suspect, including in the nearby suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was killed by a white police officer in 2014. That officer never was charged and eventually resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers also have been acquitted in recent shooting trials in Minnesota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. A case in Ohio twice ended with hung juries, and prosecutors have decided not to seek a third trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friday's protests began with largely unsuccessful efforts at civil disobedience. Demonstrators were blocked on an entrance ramp before they could rush onto an interstate, and found the city's convention center's doors locked when they tried to enter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early confrontations erupted when protesters blocked a bus filled with officers in riot gear, and later surrounded a police vehicle that was damaged with rocks, prompting police to deploy pepper spray. A freelance Associated Press videographer said a protester threw his camera to the ground and damaged it, and he was later threatened with a beating if he didn't put another camera away. A KTVI reporter said water bottles were thrown at him after a protester taunted him, drawing a crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As night fell, hundreds of demonstrators walked through the streets to the city's upscale Central West End section, where they chanted and marched as people looked on from restaurants and hospital windows lining busy Kingshighway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tensions escalated after protesters broke a front window and splattered red paint at the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, who had called for calm ahead of the verdict and later said she was appalled by what happened to Smith and \"sobered\" by the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police in bulletproof vests and helmets closed in and demanded protesters get off the lawn and out of the street in front of the house. Officers used tear gas to move the crowd out of the area and the protests were all but dispersed within the next two hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The St. Louis area has a history of unrest in similar cases, including after Brown's death, when protests, some of them violent, erupted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The encounter with Smith began when Stockley and his partner tried to corner Smith in a fast-food restaurant parking lot after seeing what appeared to be a drug deal. Stockley testified that he saw what he believed was a gun, and his partner yelled \"gun!\" as Smith backed into the police SUV twice to get away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stockley's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, argued that Smith tried to run over the two officers. Stockley fired seven shots as Smith sped away. A chase ensued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the end of the chase, Stockley opened fire only when Smith, still in his car, refused commands to put up his hands and reached along the seat \"in the area where the gun was,\" Bruntrager said. Stockley said he climbed into Smith's car and found a revolver between the center console and passenger seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But prosecutors questioned why Stockley dug into a bag in the back seat of the police SUV before returning to Smith's car. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gun found in Smith's car did not have his DNA on it, but it did have Stockley's.

Not that Hillary Clinton wouldn’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin, who will retire from the U.S. Senate after completing his fifth term in 2015, is keeping his options open, while continuing to dangle his famous “steak fry” fundraiser as a king-or queen-making opportunity.

And even though there was considerable interest by reporters who wanted to travel with him, they were put off by the jaw-dropping $2,900 cost and all decided to fly commercial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But why would Biden accept the invitation to such a high-profile political event if he was not toying with running for president? Unless he just wants to drive Hillary Clinton crazy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin likes Joe, and Harkin likes Hillary. Though he has certain caveats for both. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Biden can’t run just by saying, ‘I’ve been vice president,’” Harkin says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Hillary’s problem? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The biggest mistake a politician can make is if they think they deserve something, if they think the party is going to hand them something,” Harkin says. “People vote on what a person is going to do tomorrow.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is no secret that Hillary has an Iowa problem. She didn’t seem to enjoy running here in 2008, where she came in second to Barack Obama, nor in any other caucus state, where organization is very important. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, when Joe Biden ran here in 2008 he got 0.9 percent of the delegates and dropped out. So why is Biden coming here? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Joe Biden loves Iowa,” Harkin says. “He wants to make sure he keeps his contacts up here. He’s got a lot of friends here. I think Iowans were very happy Obama picked him for vice president.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joe Biden would be 74 on inauguration day 2017 and Hillary Clinton would be 69, which Harkin, 73, doesn’t see as a problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think [2016] is going to be an election where people, because of the times, want someone who has been tested, someone who has the maturity to be president,” Harkin says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin believes that 2016 will be determined by the results of the 2014 congressional races, the economy, and the “fragmentation” of the Republican party. “Will the Republicans nominate a Ted Cruz [the junior senator from Texas] or Rand Paul [the junior senator from Kentucky] or a more moderate person like Chris Christie [governor of New Jersey]?” Harkin asks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin believes the Republicans are headed away from moderation, which will lead them to 2016 results “that will be worse than the Barry Goldwater debacle of 1964.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin says that if unemployment is 5 percent or lower, if the deficit goes down and “there are no more foreign wars,” then the Democrats ought to win the White House in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unless they screw it up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The base has to be passionate about you,” Harkin said, “but you can’t be hard left.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, in Democratic terms, neither Biden nor Hillary Clinton, with their close ties to the Obama administration, would be considered hard left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Hillary, like Joe Biden, would be a formidable candidate,” Harkin says. “Will she run? I honestly don’t know.” But “there are pressures and groups so insistent” that Hillary runs, Harkin says, that she may feel she has to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But would she make a good candidate? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I thought she was a good candidate the first time,” he says. “She just was a lousy organizer.” He pauses. “I shouldn’t say that. Let’s just say she got out-hustled, out-organized by Obama.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But 2016 would be different. “One thing I know about the Clintons is that they learn,” Harkin says. “And she’d have another dimension by virtue of her experience with foreign affairs. And she might have a more populist appeal than in the past.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other hand, Harkin says, the party might turn to someone new like San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who also will be at the steak fry, or Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harkin doesn’t want to rule anybody out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, admit it, Joe vs. Hillary would be a pretty cool battle wouldn’t it?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Biden’s longtime political advisers grow easily exasperated about the subject and wonder how a sitting vice president who was highly engaged in the administration, especially on foreign policy, can be so easily overlooked in the presidential discussion. After all, recent vice presidents, like Al Gore, George Bush and Walter F. Mondale, generally secure their party’s nomination if they seek it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The undercurrent of ‘What about me?’ permeates from the top down in the vice president’s orbit,” one former administration official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday, Mr. Biden will visit the steak fry hosted by Senator Tom Harkin in Indianola, Iowa. The event, a 36-year-old tradition and a customary stop for presidential hopefuls, is fueling greater interest in Mr. Biden’s intentions. Mr. Harkin told Radio Iowa last week that the vice president would find “fertile ground in Iowa” if he chose to run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Biden has recently visited other crucial voting states, including South Carolina, where he will return after the Iowa event to talk about jobs and infrastructure. He canceled a fund-raising event for Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire when his son Beau, who is the state attorney general in Delaware, fell ill in August. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aides say they cannot really imagine a situation in which Mr. Biden would run against Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Biden, 70, is keenly sensitive to perceptions about his political stature, and he is sending signals that he wants to be taken seriously in the 2016 conversation. He also wants to maintain maximum leverage within the Democratic establishment, especially with the Clintons, three people close to him said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Joe always says, ‘If you’re not on your way up, you’re on your way down,’ ” one of the people said. A former administration official aide agreed, saying, “He needs to make people think he has skin in the game in the future so that they treat him relevant now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Biden, those close to him say, will make no decision about his future until questions about his son’s health are resolved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The vice president is focused on being vice president and making the president’s second term as productive as possible,” said Kendra Barkoff, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Biden does not express resentment about the attention Mrs. Clinton receives, several people close to him said, and he recognizes the history-making potential of the first female president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his camp clearly feels that his record is underappreciated, especially on foreign policy. One person close to the vice president suggested that while Mrs. Clinton elevated important issues surrounding women and girls as secretary of state, Mr. Biden took on tougher questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama administration “never gave Hillary the policy blueprint for Iraq” — an issue in which Mr. Biden was heavily involved, that person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while Mrs. Clinton was known for her grueling travel schedule, Mr. Biden also covered a lot of ground. (Aides said the distance traveled is arbitrary but added that Mr. Biden has traveled nearly 700,000 miles, compared with Mrs. Clinton’s 956,733 miles.)

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s traveled nearly as much as Hillary; hundreds of thousands of miles he’s flown,” said John Marttila, a longtime adviser to Mr. Biden. “If you compared their travel records, it’s probably similar. And he’s had a more dedicated presence in Iraq than anyone.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During Mr. Obama’s first term, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden often found themselves agreeing on foreign policy issues. They did clash on the surge in Afghanistan in 2009, which Mr. Biden opposed and Mrs. Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates supported. But they often found more common ground than either of them had with Mr. Obama, and they ended up trying to bring Mr. Obama closer to their positions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the 2011 protests in Egypt, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton both took a “devil you know” approach and, more than Mr. Obama did, saw benefits to keeping President Hosni Mubarak in power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had a standing Tuesday morning breakfast appointment at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He has a deeper relationship with her, quite frankly, than the president or any of us have with her,” said David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, who emphasized the longevity of the Biden-Clinton bond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Clinton’s relationship with Mr. Biden goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign and the affinity that developed between her husband and Mr. Biden during their work on a sweeping 1994 crime bill. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Biden shared a modest background and a down-home style of retail politics that bonded them in the early years of the administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 2008 presidential campaign brought reminders, though, of the gap in stature between Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton. Even at the steak fry in Iowa in 2007, as Mr. Biden shook hands and ate greasy food, the crowd was “packed with Hillary and Obama buses as far as the eye could see,” recalled one Biden campaign aide. That same year, during a debate on CNN, Mr. Biden erupted with mock outrage when the host Wolf Blitzer directed a question his way, after a lengthy back-and-forth between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama. “Oh no, don’t make me speak,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Mr. Biden was chosen as Mr. Obama’s running mate, his relationship with the Clintons was considered a plus. Toward the end of the grueling 2008 Democratic primary season, Mr. Obama had asked Mr. Biden to reach out to Mrs. Clinton to try to mend wounds as she considered dropping out of the race. Mr. Biden was one of the first people Mrs. Clinton met with after her June concession speech. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In a town in which the word ‘friend’ is thrown around a lot, he and Hillary are truly friends from Day 1, going back to the Senate,” said Ted Kaufman, a longtime adviser who briefly took the Senate seat held by Mr. Biden in Delaware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Clinton, who is 65, has offered no indication about when she will decide whether to run for president, and she has the luxury of time, given the infrastructure that is already being created for her, including Ready for Hillary, a political action committee that is raising money for her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the vice president and Mrs. Clinton continue to stay in touch. They will have more regular breakfast meetings in the coming months, a Biden aide said. And this month, Mr. Biden is expected to participate in an event at the Clinton Global Initiative gathering in New York, where he will be joined by Mrs. Clinton, her husband and their daughter, Chelsea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs. Clinton likes to call Mr. Biden “my kind of guy,” but they are quite different in political style. Mrs. Clinton is often perceived as inaccessible and buttoned-up, tending to lapse into wonk-speak. Mr. Biden is affectionate and freewheeling, prone to occasionally uncomfortable candor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the time he was campaigning in 2008 in Nashua, N.H., and an audience member said he was glad Mr. Obama had tapped Mr. Biden to be vice president instead of Mrs. Clinton. “Make no mistake about it, Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am,” Mr. Biden said, jumping to his former rival’s defense. “And quite frankly, she may have been a better pick than me.” ||||| DES MOINES – Sometimes Joe Biden wants to go where everybody knows his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And at Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin’s steak fry Sunday, Biden will be among friends – people who know him not because he’s the nation’s number-two elected official and who don’t refer to him as “the vice president” or, back in the day, as “Sen. Biden.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Karl Rove on 2016: Biden 'gets in' Where Biden wears shades Play Slideshow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To many activists in this state, which Biden has courted on and off for nearly 30 years, he’s just “Joe.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than perhaps any presidential candidate in modern times, Biden has cultivated a set of relationships in Iowa – and that other key primary state, New Hampshire – that date back decades, to his first presidential campaign in 1987. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (PHOTOS: Joe Biden over the years) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That race ended abruptly, when Biden dropped his candidacy amid a plagiarism scandal and the start of the Robert Bork hearings in Washington. But in the intervening years, Iowa Democrats and veteran Biden allies say he has worked hard to maintain his friendships in the state, and not merely for political reasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He developed genuine bonds during that first campaign and renewed them in his 2008 race, which ended in a disappointing fifth-place Iowa finish. If Biden seeks the presidency a third time in 2016, his friends in Iowa say they’re prepared to saddle up again for a man who has become more than a political candidate to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He has literally – as he would say, literally – touched just about every Iowan there is,” said Teri Goodmann, a Dubuque Democrat who has stayed in contact with Biden since his ‘87 effort. “Joe is a person to hold your hand or touch a shoulder, or share an emotion. Joe is a known entity in Iowa.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, who was Biden’s finance director in the ’88 race, predicted of the steak fry: “So many people will come to that event because they’re friends with him, and I mean outside-D.C. friends.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (PHOTOS: Joe Biden mingles with the stars) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He has relationships with people. Jill has relationships with people. Valerie has relationships with people,” Kaufman said, referring to the vice president’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens. “He’s gone out there for people’s funerals.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The vice president’s Iowa following underscores, in some respects, what an unusual politician Biden is in the year 2013 – a political moment dominated by politicians who rise quickly and burn out fast, and whose essential skill is typically mass communication through TV and social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the contrary, Biden is a retail campaigner of the old school, a man who embarked on his political career before the advent of cable television and whose longevity in national politics sets him apart from even Hillary Clinton among the possible 2016 hopefuls. His first major campaign appearance in Iowa was at a Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in the autumn of 1985. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (WATCH: Biden: 'Neanderthal crowd' slowed VAWA renewal) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, looking at Biden’s original Iowa team is like sending a gang of prominent Democrats from the 21st century back through a time warp. His 1988 state director was David Wilhelm, later chairman of the Democratic National Committee under Bill Clinton. Obama-Biden media consultant Larry Grisolano was, at the time, Biden’s Iowa field coordinator. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie Vilsack, were youth organizers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Iowans Biden has known for most of his adult lifetime speak of him as a recurring presence in their own lives, including at deeply intimate moments. Judy McCoy Davis of Des Moines, who worked on Biden’s 1988 race, said Biden’s contacts in Iowa are far more “two-sided” than those of most aspiring presidents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her own case, Biden sought out McCoy Davis during a visit for former Congressman Leonard Boswell ahead of the 2008 campaign. After dining with a small group, Biden gave her a “pep talk” about how to go on in life without her late husband, former Des Moines Mayor Arthur Davis, another Biden ’88 alum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: Biden wants Napolitano on SCOTUS) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He really wanted to talk to me about the fact that he knew what it was like to lose a spouse,” recalled McCoy Davis, who said Biden’s longest-standing supporters in Iowa often reassemble for his visits. “Almost everyone [can] talk about the very personal ways that he stays in touch. It’s less about the political side of things than it is just the interest in what’s happening with you.”"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR http://www.barackobama.com/reddit [edit: link fixed by staff] ||||| Yesterday afternoon, President Barack Obama took to the so-called front page of the Internet, Reddit.com, in order to answer questions from users in an AMA —\"Ask Me Anything.\" Almost four million page views crashed the servers and Obama ended up answering a mere ten questions out of more than 22 thousand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, he ignored a lot of big issues, noted Slate: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Popular questions about medical marijuana, soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder, and the president’s failure to close Guantanamo, meanwhile, went unanswered. “20 bucks says he doesn’t address this,” one Redditor predicted, correctly, about the marijuana question. “Should have been titled, Ask Me Almost Anything,” another grumbled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be generous, let's say five were legitimate questions and answers, including one on Internet freedom: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A: PresidentObama NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sentiments are vague, but positive! That's nice. Questions about what Obama would do to remove the corrupting influence of money in politics (hilariously slanted in its wording, as if Republicans were the only ones cozying up to corporations and raking in their cash) were also answered, and those are real politic issues, so uh, good for the president there. Another query from a broke law student about their job prospects got some yay-ObamaCare in the semi-legitimate response from the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another three or so were the gentlest of softballs, providing, for example, opportunity for the president to wax poetic about how hard it is to send brave American troops to die in Afghanistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And four of them were pure marshmellow goo: \"How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\", \"What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\", \"who is your favorite basketball player\", and most irritating of all \"What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already meme worthy, that last one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly this is proof that the president is hip enough to realize that ignoring questions about marijuana on Google+ hangouts, is not where it's it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe it's not totally Obama's fault —Google/Youtube wussed out back in January by picking people who prefaced economics questions with \"thanks for saving the auto industry\" and excluding all the questions on marijuana, including the highest voted question by a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe it's absurd to expect anything from the president. Why would he do anything except accept fluffy questions, or slanted ones, ripe for self-aggrandizing answers? But that makes it all the more tiresome when he find another gimmick way to play man of the people for half an hour. Why even bother? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But we already know how Obama responds when faced with a direct question about marijuana legalization: after the 2009 youtube \"townhall,\" Obama joked like a true politician, and then dismissed the question about legalization helping the economy with a breezy no. Ever since then, in spite of continued Internet-driven efforts to get Obama to actually take drug policy seriously, it's mostly been up to Attorney General Eric Holder, or Office of Drug Control Policy head Gil Kerlikowske to reassure people that the administration cares about science and health concerns, and that America doesn't have to choose between jailing people for drug crimes or forcing them into treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are other AMAs to check out, I recommend the kindergartener on her first day of school. Much more informative. ||||| President Obama's Reddit AMA Wednesday was an important moment for the intersection of politics and Internet culture. But for Reddit, the event serves as the site's coming-out party to mainstream Internet users. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From News Aggregator to News Maker NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the last 18 months, I've watched Reddit's role as a media influencer and informer rise steadily and stealthily. Reddit has increasingly become a place that I discover news, stories and issues before they bubble up to the mainstream. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I used to classify Reddit in the same bucket as other community sites such as Slashdot, Hacker News, MetaFilter, Fark and Digg. But Reddit has surpassed all of those sites when it comes to pure influence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was never more apparent than with the SOPA debate earlier this year. The opinions, research and plans for blackouts were discussed and disseminated from the site itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than just being an aggregator of news, the Reddit community was making the news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I've watched as the AMA subreddit has transformed itself — from an area where regular people with extraordinary experiences have exchanges with strangers, to a place where actors and comedians (some quite well-known) come to interact with fans and lightly promote a new project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there is a big difference between a minor celebrity and the President of the United States. Obama is no stranger to social media, having made appearances in Google+ hangouts, Twitter chats, on Facebook and on YouTube. But Reddit still felt fringe enough to be off-limits. Not any more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A President Joins the Network NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 200,000 users were viewing President Obama's AMA in real-time on Wednesday. That's not total users — that's concurrent users. The major cable news networks covering the Republican National Convention almost certainly had fewer viewers at 4:30pm ET. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal criticized the content of the AMA, describing Obama's responses as \"milquetoast defense after quip after simple explainer,\" but that misses the broader cultural point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead of using any of the other media sources he could use to deliver his message, the President and his campaign advisors chose to target Reddit and Reddit users. Just as Oprah joining Twitter was seen as a turning point for that service, the President participating on Reddit is a breakthrough moment for the service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Tough Community to Corrupt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Understandably, some longtime Reddit users worry that more broad and mainstream attention on the service will bring with it users who alter the way the way the community exists now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a common fear for nearly any web community because the nature of the beast is that as more people join, the tone and usage tends to shift. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, I don't see that happening to Reddit. While Reddit might be celebrating, its coming-out party, the service is hardly designed to gain users the way Twitter and Facebook have. Even Twitter, which is mentioned on television with a frequency that only rivaled by the Kardashian's, is not the service that has achieved a ubiquity in users. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chances are, many of the people learning about Reddit from this AMA won't become frequent visitors of the site, let alone members and link karma earners. Still, they'll have a passing understanding of the community and the social legitimacy it holds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Redditors should still start preparing themselves to see subreddits and AMAs dedicated to even more celebrities, fringe-celebrities and politicians. But the promotional value of Reddit was being exploited long before the President appeared on the service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this summer, I advised a publicist friend to put one of her celebrity clients on Reddit for an AMA. The event was so successful, Reddit is now becoming a major outlet for her most connected clients. Some users might complain about the way the AMA concept has morphed over time, but those users can always create their own more rigidly-structured AMA subreddits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the end of the day, Reddit as a resource — as a community — is too big to define or for even Hollywood to corrupt overnight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From this moment forward, however, Reddit's place in the mainstream has shifted. The influence hasn't changed — just the public perception of that influence. Reddit has made its debut. ||||| President Obama broke no new ground in his debut appearance on the social forum Reddit, answering 10 questions (of his choosing) and crashing the site. The only surprise was the venue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama made a surprise appearance on an “Ask Me Anything” session on the social forum Reddit yesterday, delighting Redditors by fielding questions on a wide variety of topics, from the difficulties of handling school loans to how he balances his work and family time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hundreds of thousands of visitors crowded onto the site, crashing it for a time. To some in the tech world, the visit was a coming-out party for such Internet platforms, a moment that showed they have the power to create news, not just aggregate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Just as Oprah joining Twitter was seen as a turning point for that service, the President participating on Reddit is a breakthrough for the service,” writes Christina Warren on the Web news site Mashable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, we’d agree it was a great thing for Reddit, per se. It shined lots of attention on its interesting AMA section and gives a boost to its overall brand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plus, it was a good move for the White House. As Ms. Warren notes, there were over 200,000 visitors on the site watching the event live yesterday at around 4:30 p.m. That’s a pretty big audience, and probably more than were watching the GOP convention at that moment. Political counterprogramming! It’s what’s for afternoon tea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So does it matter that Mr. Obama said virtually nothing new? He answered 10 questions, most of them blandly. He agreed that it’s hard to repay college loans in a down economy, said he supports the space program, and acknowledged that his hardest decision as president was approving the surge in Afghanistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His favorite basketball player? Michael Jordan. The White House beer recipe? It’s coming out soon. (OK, as far as we can tell that last one might have been new news, as we in the MSM say.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let’s try and figure this out – the Reddit appearance did not provide the US public much additional information about Obama policies. But it was important because it was on Reddit? Is that what Marshall McLuhan meant with the phrase “the medium is the message”? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’d agree with The Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal on this one – there was nothing revealed in Obama’s Reddit answers that would have interested any Redditor if had appeared on another format. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plus, as Mr. Madrigal notes, the Reddit AMA is a terrible means for extracting information from a politician. They get to sit behind a desk, choose what questions they want to answer, formulate their answers in private, and then push “enter.” That sounds a whole lot easier than holding a White House press conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ll know Reddit has really arrived as a political community when [Obama] uses a visit to announce a policy change they’ve been promoting, perhaps around marijuana policy or civil liberties broadly construed. Until then, it’s all kissing babies and shaking hands, only with more LOLs,” writes Madrigal. ||||| By Alexis C. Madrigal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's President Obama, purportedly during his Ask Me Anything session on the social network Reddit . Ask Me Anythings allow Reddit users to pose queries of all kinds of people from some guy from the show Community to Darrell Issa to the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, the conceit is that a famous person climbs down out of his or her bubble and just gets real with the Reddit community. They get intimate. They get honest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And sometimes that really works, at least as well as a Terry Gross interview on Fresh Air. The sheer weirdness of the Reddit community's questions can unlock bits and pieces of people who've had to function within the envelope of their public personas. And that's cool and fun and hilarious and sometimes profound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, the Reddit AMA is a terrible format for extracting information from a politician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Think about it this way: a politician gets a captive audience (of say, 200,000 people) to pay attention to and identify with him. The audience gets to ask a bunch of questions from which the politician selects only those he wants to answer. Those he does answer, he can answer at any length and with any level of detail. There are no follow-up questions and answers, no real penalties for ducking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The AMA presumption is unmediated access by which I mean questions can be about Anything, (\"And I mean anything!\") and they lack media filtering. Finally, Redditors can hit the President with all those questions that the media won't!!! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, OK. But maybe just asking the question is not really the tough part. Take a look for yourself at the President's answers . It's milquetoast defense after quip after simple explainer. It's a campaign stop (or as Tim Maly put it, \"a factory tour\"). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do you get to bathe in the warm glow of charisma, fame, and power? Sure. Did President Obama give a single answer that he wouldn't to a standard media outlet? I don't think so. In the 10 answers Obama gave , there was not a single one that'd be interesting to Redditors if it had appeared somewhere else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much as many would like to believe that the medium determines the message, a modern politician is never unmediated. Not in a pie shop in Pennsylvania, not at a basketball game, not while having dinner, not on the phone with NASA, not on TV, not doing a Reddit AMA. Reddit is not a mic accidentally left on during a private moment. The kind of intimacy and honesty that Redditors crave does not scale up to national politics, where no one ever lets down his or her guard. Instead of using the stiffness and formality of the MSM to drive his message home, Obama simply used the looseness and casual banter of Reddit to drive his message home. Here more than in almost anything else: Tech is not the answer to the problems of modern politics.* NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is not to rain on Reddit's parade or to deny the slickness of the Obama campaign's surprise appearance. Nice job everyone, take a bow. But we'll know Reddit has really arrived as a political community when he uses a visit to announce a policy change they've been promoting, perhaps around marijuana policy or civil liberties broadly construed. Until then, it's all kissing babies and shaking hands, only with more LOLs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Philip Bump asked me whether this was \"the goal or reaction\" to Obama's AMA. Which is a fair question. If you asked people whether they thought Reddit's technology would change politics, most people (even on Reddit) would say no. But the hope that technology can flatten hierarchies and disintermediate the media lay beneath the excitement about this development. A President recognized a new constituency that came together without the traditional hierarchies of media, that has few leaders, and that answers to no one. This is all possible because of technology, and (I think, anyway) that's why half my Twitter feed filled up with this event. Sure, it was the novelty, but the novelty portends other things. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the next year or so, slide decks across America will have a new photo that. This is it: ||||| Also in Slate, Ben Johnson and Katy Waldman run through the 10 questions from Redditors that Obama should have answered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Hi, I’m Barack Obama, President of the United States. Ask me anything,” Barack Obama wrote at 4:15 p.m. eastern today. “Welcome to Reddit, Mr. President,” deadpanned TheAtomicPlayboy. “Coolest president ever?” wondered GirlPart. “ONE OF US. ONE OF US,” chanted DirectCharge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now that his half-hour AMA is over, it’s safe to conclude that President Obama is not ONE OF US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In theory, Reddit is the rare online forum that could actually goad a big-time politician into discussing topics that his campaign would rather avoid. While its users skew young and liberal, they also have a strong libertarian and anti-authoritarian streak. Redditors are also notoriously tough interlocutors, gravitating to the most awkward and challenging questions. And the site’s structure reinforces the potential for fireworks by pushing the most popular questions to the top of the page. The OP can ignore them if he likes, but he can’t make them go away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Obama and his team surely took all of that into account. An AMA that lasted just more than 30 minutes (many of the more substantive ones can last hours) gave the president the cover he needed to skirt any lines of inquiry that might draw him too far off-message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president did answer one of the top-voted questions, about Internet freedom, though in an anodyne way: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody—from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle—and it will be reflected in the platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A concrete question about the space program—are you considering increasing funds for it?—elicited a similarly noncommittal response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama swung happily at a few softballs, like “What is the first thing you’ll do on November 7th, win or lose?” and “Who’s your favorite basketball player?” The president, we learned, will thank his supporters on Nov. 7 and is “a Bulls guy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Popular questions about medical marijuana, soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder, and the president’s failure to close Guantanamo, meanwhile, went unanswered. “20 bucks says he doesn’t address this,” one Redditor predicted, correctly, about the marijuana question. “Should have been titled, Ask Me Almost Anything,” another grumbled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in no instance did Obama engage in the sort of back-and-forth exchange of ideas that often makes AMAs so entertaining. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, the president’s Reddit visit was no more illuminating than any other social-media debate or interview. No online interrogation has yet managed to eclipse the modest bar set by a standard TV sit-down, which at least has the virtue of forcing the candidate to engage repeatedly and in real time with a single, persistent questioner."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recognizing the need for continued obstetrical care in the region, the hospital, which delivers more than 1,000 babies into the world each year, conducted the renovations at a time when many other obstetrical services at community hospitals have closed their doors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Dozens of community hospitals across the state have shuttered their OB units in recent years but we renovated,” Uniontown Hospital CEO Steve Handy said. “We saw the need in Fayette County. We want to be the place where the future of our county begins and we are proud to be that place.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The project focused on renovating postpartum rooms to private rooms with new amenities, furniture and private showers, as well as sleeper sofas for significant others and new basinets and recliners. Labor rooms were also upgraded with new furniture, flooring, sinks, counters and case carts, as well as sleeper sofas or chairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additional changes included the construction of a triage room for outpatients. This four-bed triage room is outfitted with new birthing beds and a medication station. The triage room is slated to open on July 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are excited about all the new features and cannot wait to share them with our patients,” Lea Walls, Clinical Director of the FBBC, said. “It was a long process but it was well worth it and our staff and our patients will benefit for years to come from these upgrades.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hospital also improved the FBBC waiting room with new amenities; installed a new surgical light and flooring in the cesarean birthing room; renovated the nurse’s station and locker room area, added a new isolation nursery and expanded the Level 2 nursery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the renovations were ongoing throughout the winter and spring, FBBC staff continued to meet the community’s obstetrical needs, working from other sections of the birthing center as well as from a temporary location on the first floor of the hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hospital Chief Nursing Officer Betty Ann Rock said that the renovations were needed but added that it was imperative that FBBC services be maintained while the project was underway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was important that we continued to offer the high level of care our patients have come to expect from the FBBC and from Uniontown Hospital while these upgrades were implemented,” Rock said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hospital held a community open house Tuesday evening to allow prospective patients an opportunity to discover what sets the FBBC apart from other birthing options in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is the perfect opportunity for us to exemplify what makes us better,” Handy said. “We are friends, family and neighbors caring for friends, family and neighbors with the same qualified and exceptional physicians and staff you’d find in a big city hospital working in an ideal environment to provide the level of care that our patients require.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the management of Support Services Executive Director Don Record and Facilities Management Director Biff Fagan, contractors worked to create a new FBBC area that offers increased security as well as the same aesthetic appeal that the hospital has implemented in other renovated areas of the facility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our concern with projects like this are, first and foremost, meeting our required codes and standards, providing the upgrades that will allow our clinical staff the tools and work areas they need and also incorporating the fresh and clean look that makes the unit inviting and pleasing,” Record said. “I think our teams were able to accomplish that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBBC will utilize multiple layers of security for the department, with measures including the use of the HUGS monitor anklets for newborns, which has been in use at Uniontown Hospital for years, as well as newer measures including locking the unit to through traffic and implementing new requirements for access to the FBBC floor. ||||| wpxi.com Little Eli spent some of his first hours in a neck brace after a nurse dropped him at Uniontown Hospital. wpxi.com Jacqueline Hunt says the hospital told her several different stories about what had happened before one doctor told her the nurse had fallen asleep. wpxi.com The child was airlifted to Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh after the incident Tuesday morning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He admitted at the time that cutting the deal would probably cost him politically, and it did. He lost his re-election bid in 1992. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He and his presidency are now seen in a much better light than they were then. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bush's earthbound celebration will be a dinner with 200 friends and family and a performance by Irish tenor Ronan Tynan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His jump was a tandem one from a helicopter with Mike Elliott and members of the All Veteran Group, former members of the U. S. Army Golden Knights parachute team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bush also celebrated his 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays with jumps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A just-released CNN/ORC International poll shows 58% of Americans now have a favorable opinion of Bush, compared with 47% in 1992.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His approval rating is second only to Bill Clinton's 66% rate among living presidents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 41st president marked the 25th anniversary of his inauguration this year. He and his wife, Barbara, attended a celebration event in April featuring hundreds of former administration officials, family and friends, who gathered at his presidential library in College Station, Texas. The Bushes attended some of the seminars examining his presidency and its effects and talked to many of the attendees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They just relished it,\" former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a friend since the 1960s, said of the Bushes' reaction to the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bush was especially touched, Simpson said, by the attendance of Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa at the event that spotlighted their work together pushing the Americans with Disabilities Act, which Bush signed into law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"History is sorting\" through Bush's presidency now, and he is receiving more credit than while he was in office, Simpson said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for Bush's birthday and the attention it will bring, Simpson said, \"I think he will say. 'I don't deserve this.'

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nation's 41st president jumped from a helicopter harnessed to Sgt. 1st Class Mike Elliott, a retired member of the Golden Knights, the Army's parachute team, near Kennebunkport. Elliott guided Bush to a gentle landing five years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday morning, the helicopter picked up Bush outside his home, known as Walker's Point. His family transported him from wheelchair to the chopper, then sang \"Happy Birthday\" before it took off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bush could later be seen floating to the ground using a red, white and blue parachute. He landed safely and softly near St. Ann's Church, according to a spokesman, out of the sight of reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses said he was greeted with a hug and a kiss from his wife, Barbara, and a hug from his son George. The family then left the landing zone without talking to reporters stationed nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hundreds of people gathered on the rocky coast near the church to get a glimpse of the jump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He has a lot of courage. We need more like him,\" said David Morris, 79, of Melrose, Massachusetts. He's one of several onlookers gathered on rocky coast outside church to watch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it's wonderful. I hope I can jump out of a plane at 90,\" said Carol Schierl, 75, of Green Bay, Wisconsin, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The jump was kept secret partly to give Bush himself the option of bagging it. Thursday's forecast called for clouds and scattered showers across southern Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spokesman Jim McGrath said Bush likes both a surprise and an adrenaline rush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's vintage George Bush,\" McGrath said. \"It's that passion for life. It's wanting to set a goal, wanting to achieve it. I'm sure part of it is sending a message to others that even in your retirement years you can still find challenges.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first time Bush jumped from an airplane was when his plane was shot down in World War II over the Pacific. Later, he decided to jump from a plane of his own accord and marked his 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays by skydiving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said on his 85th birthday that he'd like to do it again on his 90th. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other birthday festivities included a private dinner with more than 200 relatives and friends, including some from his White House days: press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, White House counsel Boyden Gray and political director Ron Kaufman, McGrath said. His children, including former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will be there, McGrath said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kennebunkport is a special place for the president. As a boy, he visited the family home at Walker's Point every summer, except during World War II. The retreat was later dubbed his \"summer White House.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his presidential years, Bush was known for jogging, tennis and fast-paced golf but now uses a wheelchair or scooter because of a form of parkinsonism that has robbed him of use of his legs. He signed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He's lost his mobility, but he hasn't lost his heart. He's still the genuine person that we've come to cherish,\" said Ken Raynor, a friend and pro at the Cape Arundel Golf Club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While his activities are now limited, Bush still fulfills his need for speed on his boat, Fidelity. \"He's always loved going fast. He loves the speed. He loves the adrenaline,\" McGrath said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and history who is writing a book about Bush, said the former president is used to being in motion, so it isn't easy for him to slow down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president feels lucky nonetheless, Meacham said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He had a remarkable great run of good health and good family and good friends,\" he said. \"So I know his chief view of life at 90 is one of immense gratitude. He's very grateful for his parents, he's grateful for Barbara, he's grateful for his kids. He knows he's one of the luckiest guys who ever lived, really.\""}
{"context": "Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ted Cruz passed Donald Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of Iowa polls on Dec. 12. One would have expected Trump on Dec. 13 to begin questioning whether Cruz’s Canadian birth would make him ineligible to be president. Instead, he waited all the way until the first week of January to begin whispering (by which we mean saying constantly at rallies, on television, and on Twitter) about the “precarity” of Cruz’s situation and the trouble it could bring for the Republican Party if Cruz is its nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now that it’s happening at long last, well, it’s sort of brilliant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question of Cruz’s “natural born citizen” status has been assigned to the catchall category of “birtherism,” but it’s a much different situation than the birther charges against President Obama that Trump spearheaded years ago. The prevailing birther theory held that President Obama was born in Kenya. As evidence for this theory, the birthers had nothing beyond their own stupidity and prejudice. (Typing that, though, will make it likely that I receive hilarious emails about the questionable pixelation on White House uploads of President Obama’s long-form birth certificate. So be it.) In Cruz’s situation, everyone agrees about the facts of Cruz’s birth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is Cruz a “natural born citizen” who’s eligible to serve as president? In short: yes. Cruz was born in Canada and lived there until age 4. As two former solicitors general, Neal Katyal and Paul Clement, wrote in an article for the Harvard Law Review in early 2015, “All the sources routinely used to interpret the Constitution confirm that the phrase ‘natural born Citizen’ has a specific meaning: namely, someone who was a U.S. citizen at birth with no need to go through a naturalization proceeding at some later time.” The Congressional Research Service backs up this understanding. And wee baby Ted Cruz was a U.S. citizen at birth. Those born abroad between 1952 and 1986 earned U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents were married and one parent was a U.S. citizen who spent 10 years in the United States with five of those coming after age 14. Cruz’s parents were married, and his mother meets the citizenship requirements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get Slate in your inbox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Republican primary voters are inclined to feel unnerved by even the smallest whiffs of foreignness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only uncertainty about Cruz’s eligibility is that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the meaning of the Constitution’s “natural born citizen” clause. There is a slim possibility that some Democratic goon—hello, Alan Grayson!—could file suit against Cruz’s eligibility, the case could make its way to the Supreme Court, and a majority of justices could, just for kicks, decide that “natural born citizen” does not mean U.S. citizen at birth but something else. I personally rate the chances of this happening at negative 10 trillion percent, since the suit’s success would rely on a ridiculous legal argument and the conservative Supreme Court disqualifying the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s that slight, slight chance that Cruz’s eligibility may be imperiled that Trump is sinisterly and shrewdly playing to. He is not running around saying There’s no way that Cruz is eligible!, which is usually how he rolls. He is saying that Cruz has a responsibility to the party to clear himself through the courts in the event he wins the nomination. “How do you run against the Democrat, whoever it may be,” Trump said on CNN Wednesday, “and you have this hanging over your head if they bring a lawsuit?” Trump, bless his heart, is even offering Cruz a remedy through which to prove his eligiblity: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR .@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz has been laughing this all off in public. It wouldn’t be surprising, however, if the Cruz campaign is thinking through this more seriously in private. Trump hasn’t put Cruz in a corner just yet but has put him in, shall we say, a spot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Republican primary voters, in large part because of Cruz and Trump’s rhetoric this campaign, are inclined to pick up on and feel unnerved by even the smallest whiffs of foreignness. Recall that Cruz, after news of his dual citizenship came out, renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Why did he do that? I, for one, would love to have the option of a second citizenship in Canada, especially depending on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. But Cruz perceived his Canadian citizenship as a political liability, and now Trump is reinserting the words Cruz and Canada into the news cycle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obviously Republican primary voters aren’t thinking straight about electability concerns just yet, considering that Trump and Cruz are running first and second in most polls. But Republicans want the White House badly after eight years of President Obama and the prospect of even one minute of Hillary Clinton. The fear of something, however improbable, happening to the Republican nominee ahead of the general election and “handing” the race to Clinton is a nagging one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s also worth considering how the rest of the political world has met Trump’s hypothesizing. Cruz has a lot of enemies: his rivals for the nomination, Republicans in Congress, Democrats in Congress … pretty much everyone. All of this is well deserved, because Cruz uses every person and institution around him as a prop for his own personal advancement. When Trump started talking about Cruz’s birth this week, he was not universally condemned, as he usually is when he says something strange. There’s been a surprisingly broad range of actors fanning Trump’s statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Rand Paul, who believes Cruz is a phony who’s stealing his libertarian-leaning votes, first joked in a Fox News Radio interview Thursday, “I think without question [Cruz] is qualified and would make the cut to be prime minister of Canada.” But then: “I'm not an expert on the natural-born clause in the Constitution and people have various opinions. … And we’ve had some previous cases of it, but I don't think we’ve ever gone through the court system for the Supreme Court to decide one way or another.” ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) last week made his latest appeal to the U.S. nativist fringe by naming Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) as a national co-chairman of his presidential campaign. King, called a “courageous conservative” and “incredible leader” by Cruz, is the anti-immigrant hard-liner who spoke of Mexican immigrants having “calves the size of cantaloupes” and who was a prominent birther. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR King raised questions about President Obama’s birth certificate, voiced doubts that Obama had been born in the United States, floated the idea that Obama’s birth announcement in Hawaiian newspapers may have been placed “by telegram from Kenya,” and alleged that Obama “was not raised with an American experience.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So we’re entitled to savor some schadenfreude now as Cruz himself gets caught in the birther web. Donald Trump’s questioning of Cruz’s status as a natural-born American and, therefore, his eligibility to be president is rough justice. Cruz, like Trump, has stoked the fires of resentment and xenophobia, so it’s entirely fitting that he gets burned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But however tempting it is, I’m not joining in the Cruz birtherism; it was wrong when done to Obama, and it’s wrong now done to Cruz. Cruz, I am convinced, would make a truly awful president, but he is perfectly eligible to serve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Alan Grayson, a Democratic gadfly running for the Senate in Florida, vows to file a lawsuit challenging Cruz’s eligibility if he wins the nomination. Grayson would try to argue that both parents of Cruz, who was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father, had to be U.S. citizens for Cruz to be considered a “natural born” citizen under the Constitution. Grayson also has questions about the U.S. birth of Cruz’s mother. “The Obama birthers are loons,” Grayson told U.S. News & World Report. But “there’s a very good legal argument that Ted Cruz is not qualified to be president.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Cruz foe John McCain (the 2008 Republican presidential nominee said Cruz’s eligibility is a “legitimate question”), Democratic leaders have been happy to see Cruz twist in the wind. “I do think there is a distinction between John McCain being born to a family serving our country in Panama and someone born in another country,” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that’s not really so. My friend Neal Katyal, who was Obama’s acting solicitor general, joined Paul Clement, a Bush solicitor general, in a Harvard Law Review piece last year arguing that it’s not even a close call: The constitutional evidence back to the founding makes clear that “an individual born to a U.S. citizen parent — whether in California or Canada or the Canal Zone — is a U.S. citizen from birth and is fully eligible to serve as president.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attempting to argue the contrary leads to embracing dubious and anachronistic premises such as the long-abandoned notion that children of American fathers overseas are natural-born citizens but children of American mothers are not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More broadly: Do Democrats and liberals and all those who howled about the injustice and the outrage of Obama’s birtherism really want to join the cause of Cruz birtherism, simply because he’s a Republican, or a conservative? No doubt it would be satisfying to give conservatives a taste of their own medicine, but that would mean embracing the nativism that is turning the Republican Party into a fraternity of old white men from rural areas. The right is uniquely ill-behaved these days. Why join it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn’t always this way. In the early days of the Obama presidency, I argued that the left was more ill-tempered. But now there’s nothing equivalent to the right’s rage — despite attempts to draw some phony parallels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I wrote about the overt racism injected into the campaign by Trump, the 2016 front-runner, conservative critics countered by citing the history of race-baiting by the Rev. Al Sharpton, a minor Democratic candidate in the 2004 race. When I wrote about Republican officeholders’ support for the armed men who took over a U.S. government facility in Oregon, conservatives argued that this was no different from Obama’s tolerance of “sanctuary cities” — though sanctuary policies have existed for decades without successful legal challenges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then there’s the birther movement, led by Trump, which sought to portray the first African American president as a foreigner. Now Trump is, with his characteristic disregard for truth, attempting to turn the same nativist forces against his nearest competitor in the Republican primary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no equivalent on the left these days to such nasty stuff. Democrats should keep it that way.

Their technique, published in the inaugural edition of Nature Human Behaviour, could lead to a new way of treating patients with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fear related disorders affect around one in 14 people and place considerable pressure on mental health services. Currently, a common approach is for patients to undergo some form of aversion therapy, in which they confront their fear by being exposed to it in the hope they will learn that the thing they fear isn't harmful after all. However, this therapy is inherently unpleasant, and many choose not to pursue it. Now a team of neuroscientists from the University of Cambridge, Japan and the USA, has found a way of unconsciously removing a fear memory from the brain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team developed a method to read and identify a fear memory using a new technique called 'Decoded Neurofeedback'. The technique used brain scanning to monitor activity in the brain, and identify complex patterns of activity that resembled a specific fear memory. In the experiment, a fear memory was created in 17 healthy volunteers by administering a brief electric shock when they saw a certain computer image. When the pattern was detected, the researchers over-wrote the fear memory by giving their experimental subjects a reward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Ben Seymour, of the University of Cambridge's Engineering Department, was one of the authors on the study. He explained the process: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The way information is represented in the brain is very complicated, but the use of artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition methods now allow us to identify aspects of the content of that information. When we induced a mild fear memory in the brain, we were able to develop a fast and accurate method of reading it by using AI algorithms. The challenge then was to find a way to reduce or remove the fear memory, without ever consciously evoking it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We realised that even when the volunteers were simply resting, we could see brief moments when the pattern of fluctuating brain activity had partial features of the specific fear memory, even though the volunteers weren't consciously aware of it. Because we could decode these brain patterns quickly, we decided to give subjects a reward -- a small amount of money -- every time we picked up these features of the memory.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team repeated the procedure over three days. Volunteers were told that the monetary reward they earned depended on their brain activity, but they didn't know how. By continuously connecting subtle patterns of brain activity linked to the electric shock with a small reward, the scientists hoped to gradually and unconsciously override the fear memory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Ai Koizumi, of the Advanced Telecommunicatons Research Institute International, Kyoto and Centre of Information and Neural Networks, Osaka, led the research: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In effect, the features of the memory that were previously tuned to predict the painful shock, were now being re-programmed to predict something positive instead.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team then tested what happened when they showed the volunteers the pictures previously associated with the shocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Remarkably, we could no longer see the typical fear skin-sweating response. Nor could we identify enhanced activity in the amygdala -- the brain's fear centre,\" she continued. \"This meant that we'd been able to reduce the fear memory without the volunteers ever consciously experiencing the fear memory in the process.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the sample size in this initial study was relatively small, the team hopes the technique can be developed into a clinical treatment for patients with PTSD or phobias. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To apply this to patients, we need to build a library of the brain information codes for the various things that people might have a pathological fear of, say, spiders\" adds Dr Seymour.\"Then, in principle, patients could have regular sessions of Decoded Neurofeedback to gradually remove the fear response these memories trigger.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such a treatment could have major benefits over traditional drug based approaches. Patients could also avoid the stress associated with exposure therapies, and any side-effects resulting from those drugs. ||||| Researchers able to reduce anxieties without asking people to think about them consciously, making it more appealing than current therapies NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have raised hopes for a radical new therapy for phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a procedure that can dampen down fears linked to painful memories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The advance holds particular promise for patients because in early tests, researchers found they could reduce anxieties triggered by specific memories without asking people to think about them consciously.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new technique, called fMRI decoded neurofeedback (DecNef), was developed by scientists at the ATR Computational Neuroscience Lab in Japan. Mitsuo Kawato, who worked with researchers in the UK and the US on the latest study, said he wanted to find an alternative to exposure therapy, which has a 40% drop-out rate among PTSD patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We always thought this was ambitious, but it worked the way we hoped it would,” said Ben Seymour, a clinical neuroscientist and member of the team at Cambridge University. “We don’t completely erase the fear memory, but it is substantially reduced.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The procedure uses a computer algorithm to analyse a patient’s brain activity in real time and pinpoint moments when their fears can be overwritten by giving them a reward. In the latest study, the reward was a small amount of money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers who took part in the study had their brain activity recorded while images of red, green, blue or yellow circles flashed on a screen in front of them. After viewing 50 or so images, a computer algorithm analysed the brain scans and identified the brain activity linked to each colour image.

Photograph: Mitsuo Kawato/Ben Seymour NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next part of the study was more painful. The volunteers watched another sequence of images flash up, but this time, two colours of circles, for example, red and green, were followed by unpleasant, but tolerable electric shocks. Brain activity and sensors on the skin showed the participants came to fear those images being shown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having induced fearful memories in the volunteers, the scientists then tried to erase them. This time, the patients rested in the brain scanner and thought about whatever they wished. They were not asked to think about the painful memories, and none reported doing so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even in rest, the brain is active. And from time to time, the electrical activity of the brain resembled the patterns linked to green circles or red circles, even when the volunteers were not thinking about them. When the algorithm spotted this, it flashed up a message telling the participant they had earned a monetary reward, to be picked up after the experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We don’t want them to think about fear when they are in the scanner,” said Seymour. “They are not aware what we are detecting in the brain activity.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each volunteer had painful memories for both green and red circles, but the scientists tried to erase only one of them. This allowed them to judge how well the procedure worked. And work it did. After three one-hour sessions, the brain scans showed no signs of anxiety when people were shown the images that previously made them flinch, and sensors on their skin found their anxiety response had halved. Details of the research are published in Nature Human Behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists are now investigating how long the fear is dampened down for. “It might be that it’s not long lasting, that the fear memory comes back.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One avenue the team is exploring amounts to a library of brain activity signatures that correspond to the wild and varied fears that humans suffer. Armed with that, a patient could arrive at a clinic, declare their phobia, and have therapy to retrain their brain so they no longer feel terrified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Lee, a psychologist at the University of Birmingham, said the work served as an early proof of concept. “The idea of counter-conditioning to reduce fear expression is by no means new, but the potential to achieve it outside the realm of consciousness is intriguing and would certainly have translational benefits,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Lee warned that it may be much harder to treat patients unconsciously if they have truly traumatic memories. “I just doubt that this will be possible in a clinical situation. First, any attempt to induce the pattern of activity without triggering fear and anxiety might be doomed to failure. Or by activating the pattern, this might inevitably lead to the production of fear and anxiety,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR"}

The majority of deaths seemed to occur among people who consumed more than three alcoholic drinks a day, but those who consumed 1.5 beverages daily may account for up to a third of those deaths, the researchers found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2009, 18,000 to 21,000 people in the United States died of alcohol-related cancers, from cancer of the liver to breast cancer and other types, the researchers said. That's more than the number of people in the United States who die every year of melanoma (9,000 in 2009) or ovarian cancer (14,000 in 2009). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reasons unclear NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How alcohol contributes to cancer is not fully understood, the study notes. Previous research has shown alcohol appears to work in different ways to increase cancer risk, such as affecting estrogen levels in women and acting as a solvent to help tobacco chemicals get into the digestive tract. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, is the first major analysis of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths in more than 30 years. Researchers said the lack of recent research on the subject may contribute to a lack of public awareness of cancer risks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People are well aware of other risks, like the impact of tobacco on cancer, and are not as aware alcohol plays quite a bit of a role,\" said Thomas Greenfield, one of the study's authors and scientific director of Public Health Institute's Alcohol Research Group in Emeryville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers examined seven types of cancers known to be linked to alcohol use: cancers of the mouth and pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, colon, rectum and female breast. To link the cancer to alcohol use, they relied on surveys of more than 220,000 adults, 2009 U.S. mortality data, and sales data on alcohol consumption. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breast cancer accounted for the most common alcohol-related cancer deaths among women, with alcohol contributing to 15 percent of all breast cancer deaths. Among men, cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus accounted for the most alcohol-linked cancer deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study drew some criticism. Dr. Curtis Ellison, professor of medicine and public health at Boston University School of Medicine, said the study failed to take into account several important factors, such as the pattern of drinking rather than just the amount of alcohol consumed. He said consuming small, consistent amounts of alcohol is much healthier than occasional binge drinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individualized advice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They're mixing alcohol abuse, which leads to all of these cancers as they've clearly shown, with the casual drinker, where the risk is very small,\" said Ellison, also co-director of the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research.

Klatsky has long researched the effects of alcohol on health but declined to comment directly on the study because he had not yet read it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Advice needs to be individualized,\" Klatsky said. \"The advice one would give to 60-year-old man who has no problem with alcohol but is at high risk of heart disease due to family history is quite different than the advice we give to a 25-year-old woman whose mother died of breast cancer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study's authors acknowledged alcohol can have health benefits but said alcohol causes 10 times as many deaths as it prevents. There's no known safe level of drinking, they said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is no safe threshold for alcohol and cancer risk,\" they concluded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Reducing alcohol consumption is an important and underemphasized cancer prevention strategy, yet receives surprisingly little attention among public health, medical, cancer, advocacy, and other organizations in the United States, especially when compared with efforts related to other cancer prevention topics such as screening, genetics, tobacco, and obesity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The purported heart benefits of low alcohol consumption could account for the reluctance to stress cancer prevention, the researchers said, adding that the reluctance may not be justified in an era of declining cardiovascular mortality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers said their estimate of 19,500 alcohol-related cancer deaths is greater than total deaths from some types of cancer that often receive more attention, such as melanoma and ovarian cancer.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team led by Texas A&M AgriLife Research and the Institute for Obesity Research and Program Evaluation at Texas A&M University measured food waste in three elementary schools in Bryan and Dallas. The schools are participants in the U.S. Department of Agriculture National School Lunch Program both in pre- and post-implementation of the new standards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was funded by the Alliance for Potato Research and Education and is published in the journal, Food and Nutrition Sciences. It can be found at http://bit.ly/1JEbPjz . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our research team looked at whether there is a relationship between consumption of certain entrees and vegetables that would lead to plate waste,” said Dr. Oral Capps Jr., an AgriLife Research economist and professor of agricultural economics. “We found that popular entrees such as burgers and chicken nuggets, contributed to greater waste of less popular vegetables.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conversely, entrees paired with potatoes – served as tator tots, oven-baked French fries, and wedges – experienced the least amount of overall waste, Capps said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our study shows that optimizing entrée-vegetable pairings in schools meals has the potential to positively impact vegetable consumption, which is especially important for those students relying on school meals for their energy and nutrient needs,” Capps said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data were collected by a team of “plate waste warriors,” Texas A&M students who were paid by the hour, Capps said. Each wore a different colored apron that is associated with the assigned waste bin in which the entrée is discarded. A minimum of eight workers was needed at each school during the lunch periods, which were typically 10:45 a.m. through 1 p.m. The A&M students gathered the trays containing leftover portions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leftovers were separated into different waste bags and each bag was weighed on a scale for plate-waste measurement. When students went through the lunch line, a sticker was placed on the food tray to identify the vegetable and entrée chosen.

The new nutrition standards in the NSLP of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were implemented at the beginning of school year (SY) 2012-2013. School foodservice authorities were concerned that the new standards would result in increased plate waste and reduced participation, especially by students who paid full prices for lunch. There are many reasons for plate waste, including students’ dislike of the foods served, the composition of meals, the environment in which students are eating, the lack of time to eat, or perhaps other factors. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between entrée/vegetable “pairings” and plate waste by elementary school students pre- and post-implementation of the new school meal standards. Plate waste was measured to determine which entrée/vegetable pairs produced the least amount of waste. Plate waste of 144 and 305 entrée/vegetable pairings was analyzed, pre- and post-implementation, respectively. Our results indicated that more nutritious meals were offered during the post-implementation period. The new school meal standards led to no significant changes in entrée plate waste, but vegetable plate waste increased by 5.6%. As such, increases in the combined entrée/vegetable plate waste were evident from 40.4% pre-implementation to 43.5% post-implementation. The top five vegetables in terms of popularity were all starchy vegetables, the majority of which were potatoes in various processed forms. The least popular vegetables were dark-green leafy vegetables, such as steamed broccoli, both pre- and post-implementation. Chicken nuggets were the most popular entrée and were wasted the least. Understanding the dynamics of food pairings and providing desirable entrée and vegetable pairings can help reduce waste from school lunches. ||||| It seems like an age-old problem — kids not eating their vegetables — and it is. Little ones, more interested in macaroni and cheese than sautéed spinach, are still leaving the latter largely untouched. The proof is both anecdotal — what parent hasn't tussled with this? — and borne out in data. Nine out of 10 children, after all, still don't eat enough vegetables, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem has been blamed, at least in part, for the deteriorating diets of American youth. It has also been on clear display ever since the government updated, in 2013, its nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program. Children, suddenly confronted with vegetables on every plate (as required as part of the change), have responded not by eating them but by leaving them on their plates -- untouched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a poignant example of how kids are really good at making really bad decisions about food. And it has proved pretty frustrating for health and nutrition advocates, who can't seem to find a reasonable way to get children to eat more healthfully at school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it turns out there might be an ingenious solution hiding beneath everyone's nose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers at Texas A&M University, looking for patterns in food consumption among elementary school children, found an interesting quirk about when and why kids choose to eat their vegetables. After analyzing plate waste data from nearly 8,500 students, it seems there's at least one variable that tends to affect whether kids eat their broccoli, spinach or green beans more than anything: what else is on the plate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kids, in short, are much more likely to eat their vegetable portion when it's paired with a food that isn't so delicious it gets all the attention. When chicken nuggets and burgers, the most popular items among schoolchildren, are on the menu, for instance, vegetable waste tends to rise significantly. When other less-beloved foods, like deli sliders or baked potatoes, are served, the opposite seems to happen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Pairings of entrées and vegetables are an important consideration when assessing plate waste among elementary school children,\" the researchers note. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, the effect can work the other way around. The study found that children tend to eat less of their entree when popular vegetables (mostly starchy fried vegetables, like tater tots and french fries, which many wouldn't classify as vegetables) are offered. When the entree is paired with steamed broccoli — the vegetable children eat the least of on average — kids instead eat more of the main dish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that interrelationship can be useful in reducing the amount of food wasted at schools, which has been a persistent problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these observations are probably more useful as a gauge for how appetizing vegetable are in different contexts than as a subscription for what pairings will lead to the least amount of food waste. Kids' favorite meals, after all, aren't particularly healthy. What's more, they, too, lead to considerable waste. The most popular pairing — hamburger and tater tots — still results in about 26 percent waste on average, according to the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notion that food pairings can significantly affect the attractiveness of certain foods isn't new. Traci Mann, who teaches psychology at the University of Minnesota and has been studying eating habits, self-control and dieting for more than 20 years, believes that it can, in fact, be crucial. One of the simplest ways to eat better is to make it easier to eat better. That involves a strategy Mann calls \"get alone with a vegetable,\" which is similar in that it shows how important context can be. She described the strategy earlier this year: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Normally, vegetables will lose the competition that they're in — the competition with all the other delicious food on your plate. Vegetables might not lose that battle for everyone, but they do for most of us. This strategy puts vegetables in a competition they can win, by pitting vegetables against no food at all. To do that, you just eat your vegetable first, before any of the other food is there. Eat them before other food is on your plate, or even at your table. And that way, you get them when you're hungriest and unable to pick something else instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also noted that it's been effective with kids: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We've actually tested this in a lot of ways. And it works unbelievably well. We tested it with kids in school cafeterias, where it more than quadrupled the amount of vegetables eaten. It's just about making it a little harder to make the wrong choices, and a little easier to make the right ones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, persuading schools to serve vegetables by themselves could be too tall a task. Asking them never to serve foods kids adore might be, too. But understanding how something as simple as what a vegetable is served with can have a sizable impact on whether a child eats it is a pretty useful thing. At school, and at home. ||||| The amount of whole fruit* children, 2-18 years old, ate increased by 67% from 2003 to 2010 and replaced fruit juice as the main contributor of fruit to children’s diets. Experts recommend that most fruit come from whole fruit, rather than juice. The amount of vegetables children ate did not change from 2003 to 2010. Moreover, in 2007- 2010, children did not meet recommendations for the amount of fruit and vegetables they should eat.

{"context": "Image copyright PRAKASH SINGH/AFP/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR India is in the middle of an extraordinary economic experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On 8 November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave only four hours' notice that virtually all the cash in the world's seventh-largest economy would be effectively worthless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Indian government likes to use the technical term \"demonetisation\" to describe the move, which makes it sound rather dull. It isn't. This is the economic equivalent of \"shock and awe\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do not believe reports that this is primarily about bribery or terror financing, the real target is tax evasion and the policy is very daring indeed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can see the effects outside every bank in the country. I am in Tamil Nadu in the south of India and here, as in every other state in the country, queues of people clutching wads of currency stretch halfway down the street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright NARINDER NANU/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Long queues of people wanting to exchange the old notes have formed across India NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Modi's \"shock and awe\" declaration meant that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These may be the largest denomination Indian notes but they are not high value by international standards - 1,000 rupees is only £12. But together the two notes represent 86% of the currency in circulation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Think of that, at a stroke 86% of the cash in India now cannot be used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is more, India is overwhelmingly a cash economy, with 90% of all transactions taking place that way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that is the target of Mr Modi's dramatic move. Because so much business is done in cash, very few people pay tax on the money they earn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to figures published by the government earlier this year, in 2013 only 1% of the population paid any income tax at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result huge numbers of Indians have stashes of tax-free cash hidden away - known here as \"black money\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the very poorest Indians have some cash savings - maybe just a few thousand rupees stored away for a daughter's wedding, the kids' school fees or - heaven forbid - an illness in the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Dennis Brack-Pool/Getty Images Image caption India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave only four hours' notice of the move NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But lots of Indians have much more than that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not unusual for half the value of a property transaction to be paid in cash, with buyers turning up with suitcases full of 1,000 rupee notes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The size of this shadow economy is reckoned to be as much as 20% of India's entire GDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Modi's demonetisation is designed to drive black money out of the shadows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the moment you can exchange up to 4,500 (£48) of the old rupees in cash for new 500 (£6) and 2,000 (£24) rupee notes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no limit to the amount that can be deposited in bank accounts until the end of December, but the government has warned that the tax authorities will be investigating any deposits above 250,000 rupees (£2,962). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breach that limit and you will be asked to prove that you have paid tax. If you cannot, you will be charged the full amount owed, plus a fine of 200% of the tax owed. For many people that could amount to be pretty much the full value of their hidden cash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is brave politics. Some of the hardest hit will be the small business people and traders who are Mr Modi's core constituency. They voted for him because they believed he was the best bet to grow the economy and improve their lot. They will not be happy if he destroys their savings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Businesses will no longer take 500 and 1,000 rupee notes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Modi says he is simply delivering on his pre-election promise to tackle corruption and tax evasion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says he warned that he would squeeze black money out of the system and had already offered amnesties to those who declared their black money holdings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, so far at least, the policy seems to be popular, in spite of the long queues and the fact that much day-to-day business in India has ground to a juddering halt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most Indians resent the fact that many of the richest among them have used black money to evade paying their fair share of tax and are happy to suffer a few weeks of what Mr Modi called \"temporary hardships\" to see them face justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also recognise the benefits of drawing more people into the income tax net. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR India has very low rates of tax compared to many other countries. The tax-to-GDP ratio - how much tax is raised as a proportion of the output of the economy - was 17% in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average across the economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - a club of mostly rich nations - was over 34%. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demonetisation is part of a wider project to draw Indians into the formal economy and to get them to start paying the tax they owe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/Getty Images Image caption There is no limit to the amount of old notes that people can deposit in bank accounts until the end of December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Curbing tax evasion is part of the agenda for the \"aadhaar\" scheme, a giant digital database designed to give hundreds of millions of Indians a unique ID, and of the new Goods and Services tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And reducing tax evasion can only be good for India. The more money it raises in tax, the more it has to spend on useful stuff like roads, hospitals and schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The more the country spends on public goods like that, the faster the Indian economy is likely to grow - or so the argument goes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the big question is: will it work? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some economists have questioned the decision to introduce the 2,000 rupee note. They say if the policy is designed to force people into the banking system why issue a higher denomination note - presumably an even more convenient vehicle for black money transactions? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the headlines about chaos and confusion are a bit misleading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have been virtually no reports of violence despite the huge disruption this policy has caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP/Getty Images Image caption The new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes are in short supply and banks regularly run out of them NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The queues are orderly and the worst you hear are the irritated mutterings of those whose days have been wasted standing in line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr Modi needs to be careful. The new notes are in short supply and there are not enough smaller denomination notes to go around, so the banks regularly run out of cash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That cannot go on for long without irritation turning to anger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some queuing may be excusable, because in one regard the policy has already been a complete success: it came as a surprise to the entire country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Think what that means. The government managed to plan this audacious policy, printing billions of new notes without anyone letting slip what was happening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reportedly, even senior members of the cabinet were not told what was being planned, for fear that if word got out the entire policy would be undermined. The hoarders would have time to empty their mattresses and launder their stashes into gold or other assets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keeping a secret of this magnitude in India, a country that thrives on rumour and gossip, is nothing short of a triumph and surely a reasonable justification for a few hiccups along the way. ||||| A view of a deserted street during the Bharat Bandh called by Left parties against demonetization of high value currency notes, in Agartala on Monday.

However, only the Left Front, which has a presence in Kerala, Bengal and Tripura, has called for a strike or ‘Bharat Bandh’ in the three states. The Congress and Left, which is observing Aakrosh Divas (Day of Angst), said that it will highlight the nation’s anger due to the government’s demonetisation drive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The protests were first called by Congress party and other parties joined the call. However, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee announced that her party will not join the protests.

Keeping in mind the peak tourist season, the government had decided to exempt tourists from the strike. It had issued instructions to all departments concerned, including police to take all possible steps to ensure that the tourism sector was not hit by the strike. However, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private buses are keeping off roads in most places. Autorickshaws were seen plying in some places, providing some relief to people. Police vehicles were used to transport railway passengers and patients coming from far off places to the Regional Cancer Centre. Marriage parties and Sabarimala devotees have also been exempted. Earlier there were reports that some universities in Kerala had postponed its exams because of the protest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR West Bengal: Normal life remained visibly unaffected in the first few hours. Government buses and other private vehicles were seen plying on the road. Left parties, including CPM and CPI, staged a protest. Left Front chairman Biman Bose said they are not demanding to “keep the black money like TMC”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The strike call by the Left Front has been opposed by the ruling TMC in West Bengal. “We oppose bandhs. We will take out a protest march (against demonetisation) on Monday,” state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said. The state government has ordered all its employees to attend offices on Monday and Tuesday. Exceptions would be made only in case of bereavement, maternity leave, hospitalisation and other ‘genuine reasons’, a circular issued by the state finance department said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Government and private buses, trams and other private vehicles were seen plying on the road while most of the shops and markets were open. Train services of Eastern Railway in Sealdah and Howrah sections, besides Metro Rail services were also normal, Railway sources said.

Maoists extend their support to the bandh in Odisha against demonetisation. The Utkal University at Bhubaneswar temporarily postponed all examinations which were scheduled to be held on Monday. On Sunday, the state home department directed all district collectors to take precautionary measures to ensure peace during the opposition protest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tripura: Life in Tripura has been affected by 12-hour shutdown called by left parties. As per reports, offices, businesses, educational institution and banks remained closed today morning. Government and semi-government, private offices, banks, educational institutions, shops and business establishments were remained closed due to the strike. All types of vehicles, except security forces, remained off the roads. Aircrafts in-between Agartala, Guwahati, Kolkata and New Delhi have been plied as usual. Train services between Tripura and rest of the country were affected as the Left party workers blocked several trains in different locations in the state. “There is no untoward incident reported from anywhere in the state. The shut down remained peaceful across the state,” police spokesman Uttam Kumar Bhowmik said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Official figures just released show only 1% of Indians paid tax in 2013, while 2% filed a tax return. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that publishing the data was a \"big step towards transparency and informed policy-making\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr Piketty told the BBC the data was too thin to draw significant conclusions about levels of inequality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our Govt. has taken the landmark decision of publishing the income tax data. It is a big step towards transparency & informed policy making,\" Mr Modi wrote on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data has prompted a lively debate about the extent of tax evasion in India - with commentators noting that there were very few tax returns at the highest end of the income spectrum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just six individuals were in the top-earning tax bracket - declaring an average income of $10.4m (£7.1m). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, India has at least 84 billionaires, according to Forbes magazine, suggesting a huge shortfall in the amount of income tax paid by the very rich in India. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Piketty argues that the paucity of data means it is impossible to get an accurate picture of inequality in India NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Piketty had earlier urged the government to release the figures, saying it was difficult to measure India's wealth distribution since Delhi stopped publishing income tax data in 2000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is an extreme lack of transparency for data, especially income tax data, in India,\" he told me when we met in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Piketty is famous for one of the most unlikely bestsellers ever, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His mammoth tome charts in minute detail the progress of inequality across the world over the last few centuries and has already sold well over two million copies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book transformed our understanding of wealth and inequality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It describes how the world has become a much more unequal place in the last couple of decades and - more worrying still - suggests it is only likely to get more so, with disastrous consequences for social cohesion and economic growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption \"India is probably closer to the high inequality countries of the world like Brazil or South Africa, than to the US or Europe\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gap between rich and poor in India is well-documented, but Mr Piketty has argued the paucity of data means it is impossible to get an accurate picture of inequality in what is now the fastest growing large economy in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We simply don't know,\" was his succinct response when I asked him how unequal India was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"India is probably closer to the high inequality countries of the world like Brazil or South Africa, than to the US or Europe,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But where exactly we don't really know, partly because of lack of access to proper data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see the same problem with access to caste census data that was supposed to clarify the link between caste, income, wealth and income inequality. This puts a limit on our ability to put India on a map in terms of inequality.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Piketty said the fresh data was \"a good start, but this is really just a start\" - noting that only detailed figures on income tax for one year, 2012-2013, had been released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In order to study the evolution of income distribution we would need to have the detailed data by income range for all years,\" he told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Right now we have a huge data gap between 2000 and 2012 (or actually between 1997 and 2012, because the last years 1997-2000 of the previous series of All-India-Income-Tax-Statistics displayed lots of inconsistencies). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If and when we finally obtain access to the complete data, I would be very happy to provide a detailed analysis and draw lessons for inequality dynamics and development in India.\" ||||| Some 25,000 people took to the streets of the eastern Indian city of Kolkata on Monday to protest at a government ban on high-denomination banknotes, which critics say has had a highly disruptive impact on people's lives in an economy operating almost entirely on cash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An estimated 6,000 more protested in the western commercial hub of Mumbai, police said, and there were other smaller protests elsewhere in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country is in the grips of a liquidity crunch after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government declared 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes (6.82 euros and 13.64 euros; $7.28 and $14.55) to be no longer legal tender from midnight of November 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision pulled 86 percent of the currency from circulation overnight, causing a chronic shortage of notes and widespread chaos as people queued at banks to exchange old currency. Holders of the banknotes have until the end of the year to put them in a bank account, and are allowed to exchange only a small number for new currency - of which little is available, as authorities struggle to print new notes to meet the demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Day of Rage' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The protests were called by opposition parties including the main Indian National Congress, which launched its \"People's Day of Rage\" with a rally outside the parliament in the capital, New Delhi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are protesting against the undeclared financial emergency imposed by the government and the hardships people across the country are facing because of this illegal decision,\" said Congress' Manish Tiwari. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Printers are struggling to meet demands for new banknotes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The decision to demonetize high-value currency was done without any authority and legislation and is clearly illegal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government has responded to criticism by saying the measure will fight corruption and tax evasion, with the rich being forced to pay their taxes as they have to bank undeclared income. Modi has called the scheme's detractors \"tax evaders\" and urged all Indians to switch to non-cash payment methods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is, however, something that is out of reach for many poor Indians, who have no access to banking and have been left without enough cash to buy food or daily essentials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite this, the government's aim is supported by many ordinary Indians, with the result that a call by left-wing parties for a nationwide shutdown on Monday was ignored in most states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Monumental mismanagement' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, widespread support among India's politicians as well is tempered by reservations about the way the measure was introduced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huge queues have been forming at banks NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Congress party, a noted economist, told parliament he did \"not disagree with the objectives, but it is a monumental case of mismanagement.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The way demonetization has been implemented, it will hurt agricultural growth and all those people working in the informal sector.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Modi was expected to defend the measure once more in parliament. The government says the cash crunch will ease by the end of December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR tj/kl (dpa, AFP) ||||| On the night Donald Trump was elected the next US president, one of his fellow nationalist populist politicians chose to implement chaos in a land not famed for order. In a surprise TV address Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, announced that all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be withdrawn immediately from circulation. At a stroke Mr Modi rendered 86% of currency worthless outside a bank branch. Old notes would have to be exchanged for limited supplies of new currency. It was justified as a move designed to fight corruption and target people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash, known in India as “black money”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many initially saw the withdrawal of banknotes as a price worth paying to eliminate graft. The short-term impact of “demonetisation” has been dramatic: the $2 trillion Indian economy will shrink. The rich will not suffer, as corruptly acquired fortunes have almost all been converted to shares, gold and real estate. But the poor, who make up the bulk of the nation’s 1.3 billion people, will lose out. They don’t generally have bank accounts and are often paid in cash. For them, getting to a bank and queueing for hours will cost money and time they don’t have. In less than a week the policy has reportedly claimed more than a dozen lives. The government says that it will take weeks to sort out the problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demonitisation is not new in India, which last tried it in a smaller way in 1978. The result then was higher bank deposits and a bump in the tax take. Yet the scale and speed of Mr Modi’s scheme has more in common with the failed experiments of dictatorships which led to runaway inflation, currency collapse and mass protests. While Mr Modi campaigned to end corruption, it would have been better if the government had updated its antiquated tax system to realise such a task. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But slower, incremental reforms do not make headlines. They do not instantly hit the war chests of political rivals in upcoming state polls. Mr Modi, a Hindu nationalist, was for a decade an international pariah over his alleged role in the mass murder of Muslims in a region he once administered. He wants to be known for something else. President-elect Trump offers an opportunity to recast himself. Two years ago Mr Trump’s svengali, Steve Bannon, described Mr Modi’s victory as part of a “global revolt”. But a looming cash crunch and an administrative crisis makes it look like the revolt might start at home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Comments will remain closed on this article"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This comes from high up, from New York,” said one senior executive in a reference to the paper’s owner Rupert Murdoch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sun refused to respond to any calls, emails or texts from the Guardian throughout Monday but told the Times, which is also owned by Murdoch: “Page 3 of The Sun is where it’s always been, between pages 2 and 4, and you can find Lucy from Warwick at Page3.com. “ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paper reported that last Friday’s edition of the paper will be the last that would “carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page”.

Photograph: The Sun NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Topless Page 3 models were introduced by the Sun in 1970, less than a year after Rupert Murdoch bought the title. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The change may be reversed, it is understood, if it results in a noticeable Sun sales decline. Publisher News UK has previously publicly argued, in the face of mounting opposition from critics including the No More Page 3 campaign, that the feature remains popular with its readers and those who want rid of it do not buy the paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, internally the company is thought to have been considering its options for Page 3 and appears to have been edging towards this decision for some time. The Sun’s Irish edition dropped topless Page 3 pictures in August 2013, with Dublin-based editor Paul Clarkson citing “cultural differences”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sun proprietor Rupert Murdoch made his first negative comments about Page 3 in February 2014 and then gave a stronger hint in September when he tweeted that he thought its daily diet of topless pictures was “old-fashioned”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the same series of tweets Murdoch hinted at the change that is expected to be introduced, saying “Brit feminists [who] bang on forever about Page 3 … never buy paper” before adding: “I think old-fashioned but readers seem to disagree.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then went on to solicit views about the daily feature among Twitter users. “Aren’t beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes? Your opinions please.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move follows a 28-month campaign, launched in September 2012, by a woman who asked the paper’s editor to “stop conditioning your readers to view women as sex objects”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lucy Holmes’s campaign, No More Page 3, caught the imagination of women (and men) across Britain, attracting more than 215,000 signatories to an online petition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also garnered support from a range of organisations, such as the Girl Guides, the Girls’ Brigade, most of the teaching trades unions, the College of Midwives, the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Assembly. More than 30 universities voted to stop selling the Sun until it stopped publishing topless images.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Times, which has the same publisher as the Sun, said it understood Friday's edition of the Sun was the last that would carry images of topless women, although they would continue online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Page Three has been a Sun feature for 44 years but has been criticised for being sexist and outdated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sun's press office would neither confirm nor deny the reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A campaign group called No More Page Three was founded in 2012 by Lucy-Anne Holmes, and has since gained support from a number of MPs and anti-sexism charities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Holmes told BBC Newsnight the group would not claim victory if scantily clad women continued to appear in the paper, but it was a \"step in the right direction\" if they were no longer topless.

{"context": "I was prepared to write about reproductive choices in light of the Roe v. Wade anniversary on Jan. 22. I even had some funny stuff lined up about the groups that come to my town every year to hold a march in opposition to the 1973 Supreme Court decision. But I can't write that kind of post because there was a news story about an abortion provider that was so horrific that even I cannot find a positive to his decades-long practice. In summary, a doctor who was not an OB/GYN ran a clinic in Philadelphia that apparently is the last refuge for poor women who wish to end their pregnancies. The news reports indicate that it is unsanitary, staffed by untrained people -- including a teenager administering anesthesia -- used procedures that violate medical best practices, committed malpractice by lying about stage of pregnancy of patients, that viable babies were born alive and killed, and women died of complications. This is a nightmare. Nothing redeems this. Nothing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warning: If you oppose legal abortion, please be aware that I do not share your position on this matter. However, please also be aware that I am using this post to illuminate common ground between the two poles of the abortion debate, and I am attempting to be respectful of all points of view in the process. Thoughtful debate is welcomed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I can't stop thinking about how desperate and scared women must have been to be willing to go to such a place. I can't stop thinking about how badly they were injured because they were so desperate that they had to seek the option of last resort. I can't stop thinking about all the crossroads in the months and years that led up to these moments of crisis where these women could have been better served by their communities, by the medical system, by society at large. This didn't have to happen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are those who oppose legal abortion who will likely hold this up as an example of the horrors of a society that allows abortion. I, respectfully and thoughtfully, beg to differ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First, please know that I understand the idea that abortion ends a life. If you believe that, then I see how no argument will make you feel that there is any moral allowance for abortion. I understand. I disagree, but I understand. I believe that, up to a point, a pregnancy is not a life but the potential for life and that ending that potential is tragic, and a choice I wish no woman ever had to make, but I do not see it as murder. I also believe unshakably that reproductive choice does not begin or end with the abortion debate and we need to deal with the entire spectrum of reproductive health issues in order to prevent scenarios like the one in Philadelphia. The less available other reproductive choices are, the more likely women are to become desperate and the people who prey on their desperation are to run operations that are essentially black-market abortion factories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to start with sex. People have sex. You may wish they wouldn't and many preach that, without benefit of marriage, people shouldn't, but people have sex. To give this some perspective, we should understand that the average age of completion of puberty in U.S. youth is 15-17 but the average age of marriage in the U.S. is 25-27. Asking people to be fully sexually mature but not act on that basic urge for a decade or more is a little bit like asking someone to hold in a fart for 10 years. It's not realistic for the majority of the population. People have sex, they have always had sex, they will always have sex. Societies over the course of human history have tried to put all kinds of different regulations and rules on sex but in the end, pretty much everybody does it. And you do not have the right to impose your personal sexual morals on anyone else. You don't. It's rude. So please don't try. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since people have sex, we need to provide an infrastructure for people to access sexual and reproductive healthcare. I've said for years that if I were reforming the U.S. medical system, one of my top priorities would be to give all women a free visit with a reproductive healthcare practitioner once a year. The visit would be long enough to encompass a standard gynecological exam as well as a conversation about their sexuality, their contraception needs, preconception counseling, or support for decisions not to have sex. And, of course, prenatal care would be paramount for pregnant women. If every woman were getting good reproductive healthcare and good information … well, I don't know what the true outcome would be because I'm not a medical researcher or statistician but maybe it would prevent some crisis pregnancies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You see, we have the technology to make unintended pregnancy incredibly rare. The many types of contraception are, relatively speaking, inexpensive and safe. The hormonal methods available to women are effective and safe. Condoms provide an added layer (pun intended) of protection from pregnancy and disease. Preventing disease protects long-term reproductive health and makes pregnancies safer and easier to achieve. Giving people access to good healthcare and good contraception is a major public good, and I don't understand why we don't embrace that policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You see, if women can get good care, preventive care, they won't have to seek crisis care. Right now the waters about sex, sexual health, contraception, pregnancy and abortion are so muddied with dogma and misinformation that it's a wonder anyone learns facts anymore. Telling young women that having sex makes them \"bad\" is a good way to totally undermine their self-esteem if they do have sex and lead them to make poor choices about it. Saying \"condoms don't work\" to try to promote abstinence among young people just makes them skip condoms. Waving a picture of a fetus at a woman entering a Planned Parenthood clinic doesn't make her any more prepared to have a baby she didn't intend to have -- or it might frighten her off if she's seeking contraception or general health screenings. Putting up barriers to information, to contraception, to reproductive healthcare, leads women to have sex without protection because they don't know it exists and don't think it works or just plain can't get to it. Whether those barriers be the shocking lack of access to care poor women face because of financial constraints or barriers established by those who think they have the right to police morality, the result is the same: crisis pregnancies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And a woman who is determined to end a crisis pregnancy will. It's been true since the dawn of awareness of pregnancy. When there are safe, legal, accessible means to achieve abortion, women will use them. When there are not such means, women die in clinics like the one in Philadelphia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We can do better by women in America. We can take reproductive healthcare seriously and make it a policy priority. We can ensure good sexual health information is taught by allowing those in medical fields to write health curricula rather than allowing arbiters of morality to inject opinion into the dialogue. (Morality and opinion are for parents to teach; the facts of biology are appropriate for schools to offer in my not-so-humble opinion.) We should make gynecologic care accessible even to the poorest of women and we should make the care inclusive of more than just a quick pap smear and a prescription for the pill or a handful of condoms with no further discussion of a woman's sexual health status. We should encourage women to choose knowledge and good health practices, we should teach women how to be guardians of their reproductive health. We should encourage good choices all along the spectrum of sexuality and reproduction so that fewer and fewer women need to seek the hard choices that come when a pregnancy is unintended and unwanted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We should look at the story in Philadelphia and say, \"It doesn't have to be like this. We can make it better. How can all of us, on all sides of the debates about sexuality and reproductive choices work, together to make it better?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think we can work together to make it better.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British Columbia coroner confirmed Tuesday that Monteith, from the TV show Glee, died of an overdose of heroin and alcohol. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actor, 31, whose body was found at the Fairmount Pacific Rim hotel in Vancouver, had checked himself into drug rehab in April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CORY MONTEITH: Coroner says heroin and alcohol caused actor's death NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rehab can be lifesaving, and it helps many addicts get clean for good. But addicts can be vulnerable to overdose after going through a detox program, because their bodies are no longer able to tolerate high doses of drugs, says Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. He has no personal knowledge of Monteith's case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heroin users develop a tolerance over time, so they need larger amounts of the drug to get high. Their bodies become able to withstand large amounts of the drug, Benowitz says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Monteith had a long history of drug use. In an interview with Parade magazine in 2011, Monteith said that his drug use had spiraled out of control when he was a teen and that he was \"doing anything and everything, as much as possible.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once those drugs are cleared from person's system, however, taking a big dose all at once can prove fatal, Benowitz says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Among people who have been clean and sober, if they go back into the habit, they will usually start at the same dose that they had before,\" says John Brown, an attending physician at San Francisco General Hospital's emergency room. \"Their body is now sensitive to it. They've essentially reset their body.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heroin produces euphoria by binding to receptors on nerve cells in the brain, Brown says. But many of those receptors are located on nerve cells that regulate breathing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So heroin suppresses respiration not by damaging the lungs but by damaging parts of the brain that tell the lungs to breathe, Brown says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The combination can create a vicious cycle, Brown says. The brain fails to send the proper signals, so breathing slows. That causes cells to become deprived of oxygen, which further decreases brain activity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Addicts can die because they simply stop breathing, Brown says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol, which also suppresses a person's breathing and heart rate, amplifies heroin's depressant effects, Benowitz says. And when people are drinking, they may be more likely to use drugs, as well as fail to pay attention to how much they're taking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors can sometimes save overdose patients by giving them oxygen and medication to reverse the effects of heroin on the brain, Brown says. People who survive can be left with brain damage, because their brains were deprived of oxygen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deciding to err on the side of caution, they did not initially tell the public that they believed drugs to be the cause of death. “It was the opinion of the investigators that it was a drug overdose, but we didn’t want to speculate,” said the rep.

But I don’t think anyone could even do that. He wasn’t zoned out or super hyper. He was just normal. There’s no other way to describe it. That’s what is crushing is we are all waiting with baited breath terrified that he was hiding something from us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, it turns out, he was."}
{"context": "Credit the directing duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, action auteurs who go by the moniker \"Neveldine / Taylor.\" For jacked-up action, the guys who made the \"Crank\" movies (GREAT bad movies) have no peers. In fact, they should call themselves \"The Crank Brothers.\" It fits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's still a profoundly silly mash-up of comic book and quasi-religious \"prophecy\" about a motorcyclist who sold his soul to the devil, who transforms into a flaming avenger hurtling out of hell when the need arises. But this time around, Cage and everybody else on board are in on the joke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of all the bad horror / fantasy / sci-fi / action pictures Nicolas Cage has cranked out over the last decade, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is the Nic Cagiest. A goofy, gonzo thrill ride, \"Vengeance\" is a bad movie sequel so bad it's good - a bad movie that's almost a great bad movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In \"Vengeance,\" the \"Rider\" (Cage) is haunted by the life he now leads. But a boy (Fergus Riordan) borne of the Devil (Ciaran Hinds) needs the Rider's help. Satan, who wears double-breasted suits and alligator shoes, needs the kid to fulfill a prophecy. He's commissioned Corrigan (Johnny Whitworth) to grab the kid. A wine-swilling biker-angel (Idris Elba) and the boy's mother (Violante Placido, as ineffably gorgeous as her name) are all that stand between the Devil and the boy who \"completes\" Satan's Grand Design. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The angel fetches Johnny Blaze, biker-turned-Ghost Rider. The guy who made a deal with the Devil and the woman who slept with Satan click, right off. But Johnny Blaze states the obvious: \"We've BOTH got to work on our decision-making.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cage is hilariously wound-up throughout this sequel - manic, motor-mouthed, and bug-eyed. The co-directors augment this with jump-cuts that make the Rider move with the supernatural jerkiness of a Japanese ghost. Think \"The Ring.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jaw-dropping stunts, frequent breaks for comic-book style animated \"explainers\" and OMG cameos (Christopher \"Highlander\" Lambert is a monk with Latin phrases tattooed all over his face) abound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the jokes? A lot of them land. One demon decays everything he touches - wood and flesh rot, metal rusts and crumbles. Then he picks up a Twinkie, and ... nothing happens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is still a Twinkie of a movie, dumb, loud and over-the-top in between its dead spots. But it's great to see what The Crank Brothers (come on guys, change the name) can do when you give them $75 million to make a biker-from-Hell picture. And it's great that they let Nicolas Cage in on the joke. If he's going to do bad movies - and his tax bills and oddball tastes say he must - at least let him do good bad movies.

More purgatory than hellfire. Reviewed by Helen O'Hara NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first Ghost Rider was derided for its lack of edge — something Crank’s Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were meant to fix. Instead, here’s another 12A attempt at the guy whose skull periodically explodes into flame as he sucks evildoers’ souls. Nic Cage and Idris Elba both clearly have a ball, but the plot is fatally unoriginal — Cage’s Johnny Blaze teams with Elba’s priest to save a boy from Ciarán Hinds’ devil — and it’s neither as funny nor as balls-out fierce as it should be. With the directors failing to tweak their style to fit 3D and the Ghost Rider still an inchoate presence, this is less a film than a tattoo that lasts 90 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plot Self-exiled in Eastern Europe, Johnny Blaze teams up with drunken monk Moreau (Elba) to save a boy from the devil (Ciarán Hinds) and free himself from the curse of the Ghost Rider.

More ||||| Were we all asleep while the world clamoured for a Ghost Rider sequel? Obviously. Fortunately Nicolas Cage 's return to the blazing bike saddle is a distinct improvement on its dire predecessor, although that is hardly a blistering recommendation of its quality.A wise decision was made to reboot the fledgling franchise after just one movie, with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance treating the content of the original with apparent scorn. Previous events aren't acknowledged beyond the bare foundation of Johnny Blaze (Cage) selling his soul to The Devil in return for curing his father's terminal illness - but being given a skeletal vigilante alter ego called Ghost Rider in the process. Even then, the flashback scenes have been reshot.We join stunt motorcyclist Johnny in a remote location where he has been trying to prevent any transformations into Ghost Rider. However, an energetic monk (Idris Elba) tracks him down and coaxes Johnny into helping him prevent a young boy from falling into The Devil's (Ciarán Hinds) clutches. Along with the annoying sprog's mother ( The American 's luscious Violante Placido), they hit the road and encounter an increasingly ineffectual procession of battles before an anti-climactic ending that's bereft of originality.The movie's best material can be found in the movie's first half, which features a trademark sequence of Cage flipping out and a visual immediacy courtesy of the dynamic handheld camerawork by Crank helmers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. But the script soon runs out of ideas, leading to some dismal set pieces and unsatisfactory narrative developments in the latter stages.The performances from Cage, Elba and Placido all find the right tone for the subject matter, with the actors working hard to produce a sense of urgency by steering clear of melodrama. There's the usual comforting sense of fun to watch Cage at work, particularly when one considers his recent revelation to Digital Spy that his pet cobra inspired the movements of the Ghost Rider alter ego Sadly, Ciarán Hinds's thespian prowess is largely untapped. Perhaps he should have studied a pet toad for devilish inspiration? If he did, it wouldn't have been enough to transcend the generic villain nature of the role - as he has little to do apart from scowl and permeate a stench of evil.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is far from a disaster, efficiently establishing the premise and capitalising upon Nicolas Cage's star power - laden with deadpan delivery and stylised physicality. Yet while Ghost Rider himself keeps blazing, the creative fires of the film are increasingly dampened with every reel until one can't help but wish for a swift wrap-up. Expect Ghost Rider 3 to be another reboot featuring the character as a pacifist with flowers growing out of every orifice in his skull. ||||| A water-treading sequel offering just enough kooky color to keep less-discerning funnybook fans occupied, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance nudges its obscure hero's mythology forward a bit without seeming to care much how it gets there. Its modest box-office prospects are helped by the absence of other superhero competitors during the next couple of weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Returning as the eponymous not-quite-hero, Nicolas Cage spends stretches of the film on autopilot while waiting for scenes he deems worthy of his particular brand of crazy. They're not frequent enough to please the Cage aficionado, but sequences in which the twitchy, inappropriately giddy actor tries to choke back transformations into a bloodthirsty skeleton-on-fire are welcome in a film where often-charismatic co-stars Ciaran Hinds and Idris Elba are singing off-key. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cage's Johnny Blaze hates being saddled with his super-powered alter ego, and Spirit of Vengeance gives him a chance, a la Superman II, to unburden himself: A French motorcycle-riding monk (Elba, wearing unfortunate green contact lenses) offers to lift the curse if only Blaze will rescue a boy being pursued by the devil. It seems the boy, Danny (Fergus Riordan), is actually the spawn of the dark lord's Earthly incarnation (Hinds' Roarke, the trickster responsible for Blaze's curse), and is now meant to be possessed by Daddy for good. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor enjoy some of the oddball moments in Ghost Rider's battles with various generic villains -- they can't bring the flaming skeleton head to life, but shots of its gaping maw taunting evildoers have a quirky funhouse quality, and somebody in a digital FX house should get a bonus for the bubbling tar on Ghost Rider's motorcycle jacket. But the actual action surrounding these moments is sometimes incoherent, especially an extravagantly murky showdown involving a mammoth piece of construction equipment, and the plot tying one confrontation to the next is anything but on fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the screenplay is stale and contrived (Elba's monk knows everything about everything but can't guess the one twist no viewer will fail to foresee), the picture benefits from some eye-candy settings in Turkey and Romania -- which is not to say that this scenery is well served by Brandon Trost's photography or the limp 3D effects.

{"context": "BY SHANE DIXON KAVANAUGH, AIMEE GREEN AND EVERTON BAILEY, JR. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Updated 10:05 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nancy Crampton Brophy was a writer of steamy self-published romances whose collection included a book titled \"The Wrong Husband.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her spouse of more than 25 years, Daniel Brophy, was a beloved chef at a Portland culinary school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They lived a quiet life together in the suburbs, raising chickens and tending a big garden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then came a plot twist that could have been taken from one of her many drama-filled novels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities on Thursday charged Crampton Brophy, 68, with murdering her husband in what until this week had been a baffling early-morning shooting in June at the Oregon Culinary Institute with no suspects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kitchen killing rattled faculty and students at the Goose Hollow campus, which held a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds two days later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet one of the couple's neighbors said Crampton Brophy seemed hardly fazed in the weeks after her husband's death. She casually admitted police considered her a suspect and planned to move on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crampton Brophy appeared in court in a blue jail uniform to hear the charge against her. She said little, except to confirm the spelling of her name and quietly conferred with her attorney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police and prosecutors remained silent on possible motive. In a rare move, a judge approved a request by prosecutors to seal a court document that typically lays out the case against a defendant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The family is in absolute shock right now and we are not making any comments,\" Karen Brophy, Daniel's mother, told The Oregonian/OregonLive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crampton Brophy's books featured \"rugged men, strong women and a good story,\" the author wrote on a personal website. Their paperback covers depicted handsome heroes — and at least one heroine — with chiseled bodies and dark coiffed hair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her larger-than-life characters often dodged danger while seeking fortune and love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A synopsis of her 2015 novel \"The Wrong Husband\" tells of a woman who escapes an abusive and powerful spouse during a shipwreck in the Mediterranean and who later falls for one of the men sent to find her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In writing fiction, you dig deep and unearth portions of your own life that you've long forgotten or had purposely buried deep,\" Crampton Brophy's author page said. \"Granted, sometimes it is smarter to change the ending.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her husband, 63, was found wounded by gunfire in a kitchen of the school on Southwest Jefferson Street on the morning of June 2. He later died at the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An admired teacher and peer, he had worked at the school since 2006 and eventually became a lead instructor. The institute's website described him as an expert in marine biology and mushrooms as well as a master gardener with an offbeat sense of humor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crampton Brophy had announced the death of her husband on her Facebook page the day after it occurred saying she was \"struggling to make sense of everything right now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She described Brophy as her best friend and mentioned the candlelight vigil scheduled the next day in his honor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While I appreciate all of your loving responses, I am overwhelmed,\" the post said. \"Please save phone calls for a few days until I can function.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police on Wednesday arrested Crampton Brophy at her Southwest 108th Avenue home in Beaverton and booked her into the Multnomah County Detention Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brent Weisberg, a DA's office spokesman, said releasing more information about the case at this point could jeopardize the ongoing investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A woman who answered the phone at Oregon Culinary said the school had no statements to share on the developments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one immediately responded to messages left at a Vancouver insurance agency or a Southeast Portland catering business, where records indicate Crampton Brophy used to work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everyone that knows her, especially those closer to her than myself are sick at heart,\" said Anna Brentwood, a fellow writer who has known the couple for 20 years. \"We are hoping the police are wrong and just going after the easiest target.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crampton Brophy and her husband had been married for 27 years, court records show. They were inseparable and appeared to be very close, Brentwood said. The two were even in a catering business together in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple's suburban home was bucolic, filled with turkeys, chickens and \"a fabulous vegetable garden,\" according to the author's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don McConnell, a neighbor of six years, said he and others who lived nearby thought Crampton Brophy had an unusual reaction to her husband's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She never showed any signs of being upset or sad,\" said McConnell, whose backyard borders the couple's home. \"I would say she had an air of relief, like it was almost a godsend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McConnell said at one point this summer he talked to Crampton Brophy about how strange it was that the killer targeted Brophy while alone at work.

{"context": "NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Milt Savage/For The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone knows, or should know, by now that tanning beds expose users to a lot of ultraviolet radiation, which can cause cancer. But according to a new study released Monday, indoor tanning also is responsible for an average of 3,234 injuries that result in visits to hospital emergency rooms each year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's nearly nine skin burns, fainting spells, eye injuries, lacerations, strains, sprains, bruises or dislocations every day that could have been avoided, since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the practice also increases the risk of skin cancers, including melanoma. The CDC recommends against the use of tanning beds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gery P. Guy, a health economist who conducted the study for the CDC, said the true number of injuries is certainly greater. His data include only injuries treated in emergency rooms, but not those seen by private physicians, in urgent care facilities or treated at home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Skin burns are the most common injury and women are more than four times as likely as men to get hurt, probably because they are, by far, the more common practitioners of \"indoor tanning,\" according to the new research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Younger adults, aged 18-34, sustain well more than half the injuries, again because they are the most frequent users of tanning beds. One in three women between the ages of 16 and 25 uses a tanning bed at least once a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The acute injuries also increase the risk of long-term problems, Guy said. Skin burns raise the risk of later skin cancer, and eye burns increase the chances a person may develop ocular melanoma, he said. The study is the first to gather data on acute injuries from tanning on a national basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If there is ray of good news, it's that the number of injuries declined sharply during the period examined by the researchers, 2003 to 2012, probably because the overall use of tanning beds declined. More than 6,000 acute injuries were registered in 2003, a total that had dropped to 2,000 in 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guy said people are getting the message about the dangers of tanning beds and 11 states have banned indoor tanning by people under 18. ||||| A young woman is photographed in a tanning bed at at Millcreek Township, Pa. Use of tanning devices was linked with nearly 2,000 injuries treated at U.S. emergency departments in 2012, a new study says. (Photo: Rob Engelhardt for USA TODAY) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enter an indoor tanning booth today and you may find yourself with skin cancer decades down the road. But some painful consequences could be immediate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An estimated 1,957 indoor tanners landed in U.S. emergency rooms in 2012 after burning their skin or eyes, fainting or suffering other injuries, researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The good news is that such injuries fell from 6,487 in 2003, says a report published in JAMA Internal Medicine. The report is the first nationally representative look at immediate injuries related to indoor tanning, says CDC researcher Gery Guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've seen several studies showing indoor tanning increases the risk of skin cancer, both melanoma and non-melanoma,\" contributing to about 400,000 cancers a year in the United States, he says. \"We're looking at more acute injuries.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using data from 66 hospital emergency departments, the researchers estimated nationwide injury numbers for 2003-12. The fact that numbers fell over time might be explained by declining use of tanning beds, booths and lamps, Guy says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A tanning industry spokesman says the numbers suggest indoor tanning is safe and getting safer. An estimated 1 million people use indoor tanning facilities each day, so the injury rates in the study are tiny, says John Overstreet, executive director of the Indoor Tanning Association. And the drop in injuries far exceeds any recent drop in customers, Overstreet says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These businesses take the welfare of the customers seriously,\" he says. \"Injured customers are unhappy customers, and staff is trained to show the customer how to use the equipment properly and make sure people are not overexposed or sunburned.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guy says the actual number of injuries is certainly higher because the study did not include injured people who did not go to emergency rooms. The prevalence of burns, he says, suggests users or salon personnel sometimes misuse timers required on the devices. For example, he says, some operators may allow light-skinned or new users to stay in longer than recommended by manufacturers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report says 5% of injuries occurred at home and 64% occurred in public places, including salons and gyms. The rest of the locations were unreported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 80% of the injuries were skin burns, 6% were eye injuries and 9.5% involved people who got dizzy or passed out, probably from overheating, Guy says. The rest were cuts and other injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such skin burns, like outdoor sunburns, increase the risk of skin cancer, he says, while eye burns increase the risk of cataracts and eye melanoma. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A majority of the injured were young white women; about 13% were under age 18. Under new Food and Drug Administration rules, tanning devices will soon have to carry labels warning against use by people under 18. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The injury findings \"are not surprising,\" says dermatologist Darrel Rigel, a clinical professor at New York University Medical Center in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The burns I've seen have been pretty intense, the kind that can leave a scar,\" he says. \"It's a serious problem.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tanners, he says, should see their habit like smoking — something that could hurt them every time they do it and could kill them later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The earlier you start, the worse it is,\" he says. \"But, like with cigarette smoking, it always pays to stop.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1AA1scN ||||| Indoor tanning exposes users to intense UV radiation, which is a known carcinogen.1 However, little is known about the more immediate adverse outcomes of indoor tanning.

Close NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington and Colorado voters legalized recreational use of marijuana, making them the first U.S. states to decriminalize the practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington will allow those at least 21 years old to buy as much as one ounce (28 grams) of marijuana from a licensed retailer. Colorado’s measure allows possession of an ounce, and permits growing as many as six plants in private, secure areas. Oregon voters rejected a similar measure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The voters have spoken and we have to respect their will,” Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said in a statement. “This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through. That said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug so don’t break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Support for marijuana’s recreational use built on measures that allow it for medical purposes in one-third of U.S. states. Previous attempts to legalize pot through ballot measures failed in California, Alaska, Oregon, Colorado and Nevada since 1972, according to the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado said federal law was not affected by the vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Department of Justice’s enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged,” said Jeff Dorschner in a statement. “We are reviewing the ballot initiative and have no additional comment at this time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Leaf NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington, Colorado and Oregon were among six states with marijuana on their ballots. In Massachusetts, residents approved a measure to allow medical use, while Arkansas voters rejected such a proposal. Medical-marijuana use is already permitted in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Montana residents voted to restrict the use of medical marijuana, the Associated Press said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s very monumental,” said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a Washington-based group that advocates legalization. “No state has ever done this. Technically, marijuana isn’t even legal in Amsterdam.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The approval of recreational pot goes a step beyond its acceptance in medical use. California was the first state to permit medical-marijuana when voters approved it in 1996. Federal prosecutors cracked down on the medical-marijuana industry in California last year, threatening landlords with jail if they didn’t evict the shops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Looking Askance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Regardless of state laws to the contrary, there is no such thing as ‘medical’ marijuana under federal law,” according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder released a letter a month before California voters considered a ballot measure to legalize recreational use of marijuana in 2010, saying the Justice Department would “vigorously” enforce federal law. The initiative failed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Justice Department spokesman, Dean Boyd, declined to comment yesterday when reached by telephone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington state, decriminalization and new rules on driving under the influence take effect Dec. 6. The state liquor control board must adopt rules by Dec. 1, 2013 for licensing producers, processors and retailers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Washington measure may generate as much as $1.9 billion in revenue over five fiscal years, according to the state’s Office of Financial Management. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the reporter on this story: Alison Vekshin in San Francisco at avekshin@bloomberg.net NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at smerelman@bloomberg.net ||||| Voters approved an amendment legalizing recreational marijuana use in Colorado on Tuesday, making this one of two states to end prohibition of the drug but also raising new legal questions and setting up potential court battles over the measure's implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The historic result, projected by The Denver Post Tuesday night, drew raucous cheers and applause from the amendment's supporters, who gathered in hundreds at Casselman's in downtown Denver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We won! We won!” supporters cried as the results were splashed across a giant screen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amendment 64 led late Tuesday night with 53.3 percent voting yes and 46.7 percent voting no, with 1,863,535 votes or about 66 percent of active voters counted, according to the Colorado Secretary of State's office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is really groundbreaking,” said Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center. “No modern jurisdiction has ever removed the prohibition on the production and possession of marijuana for recreational purposes. ... Since no one has done this before, there are a lot of uncertainties.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voters in Washington state approved a similar measure Tuesday; in Oregon a legalization issue failed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The amendment will allow those 21 and older to purchase up to one ounce of the drug at specially regulated retail stores. Possession would be legal but not public use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adults could grow up to six marijuana plants in their homes. It also sets up a direct challenge to federal drug law, which regulates it as an illegal substance. Federal authorities have not said how they will respond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This demonstrates that the people of Colorado are just as smart as we thought they were,” said Mason Tvert, one of the directors of the Yes on 64 Campaign. “They were fed up with prohibition and decided they want a more sensible approach.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tvert and other supporters of the measure have said it will generate tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue for state and local governments. They said it would shed light on the black-market marijuana industry and ultimately case dangerous cartels to wither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics argued that passing the amendment would make Colorado a destination for drug tourists and prompt a federal crackdown. They cited concerns about increased use of the drug by children and more drugged driving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the opponents was Gov. John Hickenlooper, who said in a statement Tuesday night that “the voters have spoken and we have to respect their will. This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through. That said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug so don't break out the Cheetos or gold fish too quickly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smell of the drug wafted through the supporters' party at Casselman's Tuesday night. But state criminal penalties for possessing the drug won't disappear until the election is certified, which could take up to two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions about regulation and enforcement still abound. The first recreational stores would be slated to open in January 2014 and would be separate from existing medical marijuana dispensaries. Local governments could ban marijuana sales, and employers could still bar employees from using the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The amendment doesn't spell out the details of how the commercial marijuana industry will be regulated. It leaves that up to the state Department of Revenue, which would oversee the specialty shops. Proponents envision something similar to the state's system governing medical-marijuana businesses, which involves security requirements, the monitoring of plants as they are grown and shipped and auditors who perform site checks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Colorado has a lot of work to do quickly in terms of setting up the appropriate rules and structures,” said Rosalie Pacula, another co-director for Rand's Drug Policy Research Center. She noted that because the measure is a constitutional amendment, it will have to go back to voters for repairs if there are problems; the legislature will be unable to intervene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal government's response is anyone's guess, she said, but it will likely be resistant. Other experts have said federal agents could arrest individual users where local authorities are not, though that would be a departure from their usual focus on large-scale dealers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the year before the first stores open, the federal government may choose to challenge the measure in court by arguing that it is pre-empted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for the Colorado U.S. attorney's office said only that the office would not change its approach to enforcement, which for medical marijuana has included ordering dispensaries near schools to shut down and raids on retailers who allegedly sell to the black-market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are reviewing the ballot initiative and have no additional comment at this time,” spokesman Jeff Dorschner said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML, a national group that lobbies for legalization, said he has heard from friends and family already planning trips to Colorado for the “cannabis tourism” that will certainly become popular. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That sort of enthusiasm is hard not to recognize right off the bat,” he said.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outcome in Maine and Maryland broke a 32-state streak, dating back to 1998, in which gay marriage had been rebuffed by every state that voted on it. They will become the seventh and eighth states to allow same-sex couples to marry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For the first time, voters in Maine and Maryland voted to allow loving couples to make lifelong commitments through marriage - forever taking away the right-wing talking point that marriage equality couldn't win on the ballot,\" said Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay-rights group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington state also was voting on measures to legalize same-sex marriage, while Minnesota voters were considering a conservative-backed amendment that would place a ban on same-sex marriage in the state constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The marijuana measures in Colorado and Washington set up a showdown with the federal government, which outlaws the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colorado's Amendment 64 will allow adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana, though using the drug publicly would still be banned. The amendment would also allow people to grow up to six marijuana plants in a private, secure area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington's measure establishes a system of state-licensed marijuana growers, processors and retail stores, where adults can buy up to an ounce (28 grams). It also establishes a standard blood test limit for driving under the influence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Washington measure was notable for its sponsors and supporters, who ranged from public health experts and wealthy high-tech executives to two of the Justice Department's top former officials in Seattle, U.S. Attorneys John McKay and Kate Pflaumer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Marijuana policy reform remains an issue where the people lead and the politicians follow,\" said Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, which opposes the co-called \"war on drugs.\" \"But Washington state shows that many politicians are beginning to catch up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Estimates show that pot taxes could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales won't start until state officials make rules to govern the legal weed industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Massachusetts, voters approved a measure to allow marijuana use for medical reasons, joining 17 other states. Arkansas voters were deciding on a similar measure that would make it the first Southern state in that group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maine's referendum on same-sex marriage marked the first time that gay-rights supporters put the issue to a popular vote. They collected enough signatures over the summer to schedule the vote, hoping to reverse the outcome of a 2009 referendum that quashed a gay-marriage law enacted by the state Legislature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In both Maryland and Washington, gay-marriage laws were approved by lawmakers and signed by the governors earlier this year, but opponents gathered enough signatures to challenge the laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the most active advocacy group opposing same-sex marriage, Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage, insisted the Maryland and Maine results did not mark a watershed moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At the end of the day, we're still at 32 victories and they've got two,\" he said. \"Just because two extreme blue states vote for gay marriage doesn't mean the Supreme Court will create a constitutional right for it out of thin air.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Minnesota, the question was whether the state would join 30 others in placing a ban on gay marriage in its constitution. Even if the ban is defeated, same-sex marriage would remain illegal in Minnesota under statute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heading into the election, gay marriage was legal in six states and Washington, D.C. _ in each case the result of legislation or court orders, not by a vote of the people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In California, voters were deciding whether to repeal the state's death penalty. If the measure prevailed, the more than 720 inmates on death row there would have their sentences converted to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While 17 states have ended capital punishment, most did so through legislative action. Only in Oregon, in 1964, did voters choose to repeal the death penalty; they later reversed themselves to reinstate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In all, there were 176 measures on the ballots Tuesday in 38 states, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other notable ballot measures: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ Maryland voters approved a measure allowing illegal immigrants to pay lower in-state college tuition, provided they attended a state high school for three years and can show they filed state income tax returns during that time. About a dozen other states have similar laws, but Maryland's is the first to be approved by voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ In Oklahoma, voters approved a Republican-backed measure that wipes out all affirmative action programs in state government hiring, education and contracting practices. Similar steps have been taken previously in Arizona, California, Michigan, Nebraska and Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ In Michigan, labor unions suffered a big loss. Voters rejected a first-of-its-kind ballot initiative that would have put collective bargaining rights in the state constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP ||||| Oregon voters were in a mostly naysaying mood when it came to statewide ballot measures, with partial returns showing all but two citizen initiatives headed for defeat Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Measures related to casinos, marijuana, gill netting and estate taxes all got the heave-ho, while proposals to divert corporate \"kicker\" tax refunds to public schools and ban real estate sales taxes passed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oregonians have seen the impact of more than a decade of ongoing school budget cuts,\" said Scott Moore, spokesman for Our Oregon, the union-backed group that championed the kicker change. \"We've reached a tipping point and voters are really demanding something be done to invest in our K-12 schools.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also approved were two house-cleaning measures put on the ballot by the Legislature. One outlines how government would function in the event of a catastrophic emergency, the other makes minor word changes to the state constitution regarding references to \"branches of government.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all the noise, bother and shake-up potential of the campaigns, Oregon will barely change in the wake of the elections. Residents still won't be allowed to grow and smoke pot at will, there won't be a big casino complex at Portland's doorstep and the state will continue to collect inheritance taxes on estates worth more than $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the change to the state's unique-in-the-nation kicker law and the ban on real estate taxes won't be noticed by most Oregonians. Measure 85, which was leading 60 percent to 40 percent, affects corporations, not individual taxpayers. Most Oregonians will continue to be eligible for kicker refunds if state revenues exceed projections by 2 percent or more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the event of a corporate kicker -- which hasn't happened in at least five years -- the money will now go into a special fund for schools instead of being rebated to companies that pay income taxes in Oregon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Oregon doesn't have a statewide real estate tax -- Measure 79 is more of a pre-emptive strike. Realtors chunked in more than $5 million to help ensure its passage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voters were less charitable with heirs to $1 million-plus estates. Measure 84, which would have phased out Oregon's inheritance taxes, was losing by 10 percentage points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most resounding defeats of the night went to the two casino measures. Measure 82, which sought to amend the state constitution to allow nontribal casinos, and Measure 83, which would have allowed a casino to be built in Wood Village, were failing by 40 percentage points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters, bankrolled by Canadian investors, spent more than $5 million on the two measures, but suspended their campaign with several weeks to go after polls showed little public support. Opponents, bankrolled by a tribe with a casino west of Salem that stood to lose business, spent close to $3 million to maintain their competitive edge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Measure 80, which would have made it legal to possess and use marijuana recreationally, was going down 55 percent to 45 percent. Supporters spent close to half a million dollars getting the measure on the ballot, but had little left for a campaign to pass it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similar pot legalization measures in Washington and Colorado were ahead in late vote tallies. Oregon's had the distinction as the least restrictive, allowing adults to grow and possess unlimited amounts for personal use, and setting up a separate state commission to license growers and sell to the public in state-run stores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also defeated was a measure that would have banned nontribal gill netting on the Columbia River. Supporters of the measure suspended their campaign and urged a \"no\" vote after Gov. John Kitzhaber helped broker a compromise on the issue.

{"context": "LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Denzel Washington hit the bullseye again. “The Magnificent Seven,” the Oscar-winner’s first western, topped the box office, picking up a solid $35 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hollywood’s star system has shriveled in the past decade, with few new talents emerging to reanimate the ranks and stand alongside Leo and Julia and Johnny and George and Brad. Some of their stars have dimmed, but Washington’s still shines brightly. He hasn’t had a film open to less than $20 million since 2007’s “The Great Debaters.” He’ll be back on screens at the end of the year in “Fences,” an adaptation of August Wilson’s play, that he directs and stars in alongside Viola Davis. It is expected to be an Oscar contender. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Magnificent Seven” easily snagged the crown from “Sully,” the retelling of the “Miracle on the Hudson” landing that topped the box office for two weeks. The drama slid to third place with $13.8 million, bringing its stateside total to a healthy $92.4 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Storks,” an animated comedy from Warner Bros., came in second with $21.8 million. It’s a disappointing result given that the picture had been tracking to open to $30 million or higher. The film centers on a group of storks who have transitioned from baby delivering to hauling packed for an e-commerce behemoth. Andy Samberg, Kelsey Grammer, Jennifer Aniston, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jordan Peele are among the recognizable voices providing some of the film’s aural texture. The film cost $70 million to produce and is part of Warner Bros. effort to reinvigorate its animation division after the studio scored a hit with 2014’s “The Lego Movie.” It had more or less abandoned the genre to the likes of Disney and DreamWorks Animation, before undergoing a course correction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Magnificent Seven’s” success is welcome news for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was body checked this summer after “Ben-Hur,” its $100 million-plus Biblical epic, collapsed at the box office, resulting in at least $70 million in losses for the studio and its production co-financiers. Earlier this month, MGM reduced its annual profit projections by roughly $50 million because of “Ben-Hur’s” failure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But “The Magnificent Seven” counts as a win for the company. It also proves the viability of remaking older films, provided their is some novel spin to provide. In this case, Washington and director Antoine Fuqua, were able to stage balletic shootouts that rivaled those in John Sturges’ original 1960 film. They also played up the diversity of their cast, rounding out the cast of mercenaries with South Korean actor Byung-hun Lee, Mexican actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and Native American actor Martin Sensmeier. That multi-cultural aspect seemed to resonate in a post-#OscarsSoWhite era. Sony Pictures distributed “The Magnificent Seven” and teamed with MGM, LStar Capital, and Village Roadshow to finance the $90 million production. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Bridget Jones’s Baby” took fourth place with $4.5 million, pushing the romantic comedy’s domestic total to a lackluster $16.5 million after two weeks of release. “Blair Witch” rounded out the top five, earning just under $4 million and bringing its total to roughly $16 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In limited release, “The Dressmaker,” an Australian comedy with Kate Winslet, opened to $180,522 in 38 locations. Broad Green is distributing the film on behalf of Amazon Studios. Disney’s “Queen of Katwe,” an inspirational drama about a chess prodigy from Uganda, debuted in 55 theaters to $305,000. It will expand next weekend to roughly 1,500 locations."}

He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The entrance to the city has been closed. Security forces were combing the area for other suspicious packages or objects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Channel 2 reporter said that the Palestinian Red Crescent contacted the emergency services to offer assistance in evacuating the wounded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 59-year-old woman who was killed in the explosion was believed to be a foreign citizen, and her name was not cleared for publication since her family has yet to be notified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman was seriously wounded as a result of the bombing, and rescue services transferred her to the emergency room in the Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital. Doctors fought for her life for about an hour and ultimately were forced to declare her dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials in the hospital said that until the late evening hours no family or friends came to look for the woman, and noted that several documents that she possessed indicated that she was a foreign citizen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bombing occurred just hours after Gaza militants fired two Grad-type Katyusha rocket at the southern city of Be'er Sheva and a barrage of mortar shells on the western Negev. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed his scheduled trip to Moscow in the wake of the Jerusalem bombing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerusalem has been hit by a number of terror attacks over the last few years, two of them involving tractor drivers that ploughed down a central street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the first incident in July 2008, a bulldozer driver hit a bus, pedestrian and cars before he was neutralized by a soldier and civilian who mounted his vehicle and overtook him and then shot and killed him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second attack took place three weeks later. Twenty-four people were injured in the attack, one of which moderately to critically wounded. The terrorist hit five cars before he was shot by a civilian and an IDF military border guard officer that were at the scene of the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three months later, 19 people were injured - two of them critically and four moderately -when an East Jerusalem resident veered off the street onto the sidewalk near the Old City of Jerusalem and crashed into pedestrians. Most of the pedestrians were soldiers. An officer among the group open fire and killed the terrorist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The capital suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bomb had been left in a bag by the side of the road near the central bus station, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerusalem suffered a spate of bus bombings by Palestinian militants between 2000 and 2004 but attacks had stopped in recent years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel's prime minister said the country would act aggressively to restore security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Israel will act aggressively, responsibly and wisely to preserve the quiet and security that prevailed here over the past two years,\" Benjamin Netanyahu said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the attackers sought to test the country's will and determination and said the Israeli people had \"an iron will\" to defend their country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shattered windows NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses said the force of the blast - just after 1500 local time (1300 GMT) - shook buildings over a wide area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of ambulances converged on the scene near the entrance to the city, and police sealed off the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is believed the bomb exploded as a bus pulled up at the stop, but it is not clear if passengers on the bus were among the casualties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli officials initially said no-one had been killed in the blast but later confirmed that a woman had died from her injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the scene The explosion happened right in the heart of west Jerusalem - a city that has, for many years, been relatively peaceful. The target was the No 74 bus - its windscreen blown out by the force of the blast. There was shrapnel damage everywhere. But, unlike previous incidents, police say this was not a suicide bombing and there is now an urgent man-hunt going on for someone who, according to police, left a device at the bus stop and then ran away. Dozens of paramedics and emergency vehicles were quickly at the scene - treating more than 30 wounded people. Such a bomb attack in Jerusalem may not have happened for many years, but it comes at a time of increased tension in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Political leaders, Israeli and Palestinian, have condemned the upsurge in violence but many observers say these are tense moments and more violence may be inevitable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A correspondent for AFP news agency at the scene said people were lying on the ground covered in blood and many cars and buses had shattered windows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(We believe) the device weighed about 1-2kg (2-4lb),\" Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch told Israel's Channel 2 television. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It exploded in a small suitcase on the sidewalk next to the bus stop.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Motti Bukchin, a volunteer with the Israeli emergency service Zaka, said he and his colleagues were in a meeting nearby when they heard the blast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we arrived at the site of the attack we saw two women lying in huge pools of blood on the pavement. We began resuscitation immediately and were soon joined by other medical personnel. The two women were evacuated to hospital in serious to critical condition,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC they were searching for a suspect and a vehicle believed to have been used in planting the bomb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medics said many of the injured had shrapnel wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three are seriously injured and five are in \"a moderate condition, while the rest are less badly hurt\", Uri Shacham, a senior paramedic told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the attack, Prime Minister Netanyahu met defence and security officials, delaying by a few hours a scheduled trip to Moscow where he is due to hold talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Unacceptable' attack NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerusalem was hit by a series of bombings - mostly targeting buses and restaurants - during the second Palestinian uprising that began in 2000.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bombing brought back memories of the second Palestinian uprising last decade, a period in which hundreds of Israelis were killed by suicide bombings in Jerusalem and other major cities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Israeli police blamed Palestinian militants. The attack came against the backdrop of a rising wave of violence that has threatened to upset more than two years of relative calm that has prevailed since an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, five members of a Jewish settler family were knifed to death in their sleep at their West Bank home. And in recent days, Israel has carried out reprisals in Gaza in retaliation for rocket and mortar fire launched into southern Israel. On Tuesday, an errant Israeli strike meant for Palestinian militants killed four members of a Palestinian family in Gaza. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adding to the tensions, peace efforts with Hamas' rival, the Western-backed Palestinian government in the West Bank, have been stalled for months. Palestinian leaders condemned the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak hinted that Israel would retaliate against Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza. At least three rockets landed in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday, and mortar shells were landing in southern Israel late in the afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will not tolerate the harming of Israeli citizens, not in the south and not in Jerusalem,\" Barak said. \"Hamas is responsible for the firing of rockets toward Beersheba today and this responsibility has a price.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 3 p.m. bombing occurred near the main entrance to Jerusalem, next to the city's central bus station and main convention center, an area that is crowded with travelers and passers-by. The bomb went off next to the a food stand ironically called, in a Hebrew play on words, \"a blast of a kiosk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blast reverberated throughout Jerusalem and blew out the windows of two crowded buses. Rescuers removed bloodied people from the area on stretchers, as sirens from speeding ambulances wailed in the background. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are talking about a terror attack,\" said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said a 60-year-old woman died from her wounds. Israel's national rescue service said some 24 others were wounded, including three in critical condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerusalem's police chief, Aharon Franco, said that the bomb was about four pounds (one to two kilograms) and was planted in a small bag on the sidewalk. He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said authorities had no firm leads but were investigating a possible link to a small bombing earlier this month that wounded a garbage collector as he removed the device from a trash can. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I saw kids crying on the street, lying in blood on the side of the road,\" said one man who witnessed the blast. Crying on the telephone, he frantically tried to reach his daughter, calming down a bit when he found out she was safe. The man, trembling in shock, refused to give his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radio and TV stations posted emergency numbers for concerned citizens to inquire about relatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meir Hagid, one of the bus drivers, said he heard a loud explosion as he drove by the site, located near the main entrance to Jerusalem and its central bus station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I heard the explosion in the bus stop,\" he said. He halted his vehicle and people got off. He said nobody in his bus was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Samuel Conik, 20, said he ran to the scene when he heard the explosion and saw fire coming out of a phone booth. Nearby was a badly burned man with bloody legs and his skin peeling off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the scene, a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews began chanting \"Death to Arabs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eli Yishai, Israel's interior minister, rushed to the scene and called for swift Israeli retaliation. \"With these murderers, these terror organizations ... we must act, or we will lose our deterrence,\" he told Channel 2 TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader had decided to delay a planned trip to Moscow for several hours to deal with the crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police, accompanied by sniffer dogs, broke into cars near the site to search for evidence and possible additional explosives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Palestinians are divided between two rival governments, the Hamas regime in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The West Bank government seeks peace with Israel, though talks broke down last September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the bombing \"in the strongest terms.\" His boss, President Mahmoud Abbas, who was traveling in Russia, issued a similar condemnation through his office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Gaza Strip, the Islamic Jihad militant group, which has carried out dozens of attacks, said it was not connected to the blast. But spokesman Khader Habib said the group \"applauds all efforts to respond to the crimes committed daily against our people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jerusalem suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. But the attacks have halted in recent years. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004, and the last suicide bombing in Israel occurred in 2008 in the southern town of Dimona. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, the city has experienced other deadly violence. In early 2008, eight students at a Jerusalem seminary were killed when Palestinian gunmen entered the school and opened fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Palestinians also carried out several attacks with construction vehicles against Jerusalem in the past few years that ended with fatalities when the drivers rammed their vehicles into bystanders."}

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 170,000 people have been ordered to evacuate the area covering a radius of 12 miles (20 kilometers) around the plant in Fukushima near Iwaki. A meltdown refers to a very serious collapse of a power plant's systems and its ability to manage temperatures. A complete meltdown would release uranium and dangerous byproducts into the environment that can pose serious health risks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that a partial meltdown in Unit 3 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant is \"highly possible.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because it's inside the reactor, we cannot directly check it but we are taking measures on the assumption of the possible partial meltdown,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan dealt with the nuclear threat as it struggled to determine the scope of the twin disasters Friday, when an 8.9-magnitude earthquake, the most powerful in its recorded history, was followed by a tsunami that ravaged its northeastern coast with breathtaking speed and power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official count of the dead was 763, but the government said the figure could far exceed 1,000. Media reports said some 10,000 people were missing or unaccounted for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unit 3 is one of the three working reactors at the Fukushima plant that were damaged, losing the cooling functions necessary to keep the fuel rods working properly. The other unit in trouble is called Unit 1. The facility's Unit 2 has not been affected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, an explosion destroyed the walls of Unit 1 as operators desperately tried to prevent it from overheating and melting down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Edano said cooling operation at Unit 1 was going smoothly after sea water was pumped in. He expressed hope that it would keep the plant under control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Operators released slightly radioactive air from Unit 3 Sunday, while injecting water into it as an effort to reduce pressure and temperature to save the reactor from a possible meltdown, Edano said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said radiation levels briefly rose above legal limits, but that it has since declined significantly. Also, fuel rods were exposed briefly, he said, indicating that coolant water didn't cover the rods for some time. That would contribute further to raising the temperature in the reactor vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, the government doubled the number of troops pressed into rescue and recovery operations to about 100,000 from 51,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teams searched for the missing along hundreds of miles (kilometers) of the Japanese coast, and thousands of hungry survivors huddled in darkened emergency centers that were cut off from rescuers and aid. At least a million households had gone without water since the quake struck. Large areas of the countryside were surrounded by water and unreachable. Some 2.5 million households were without electricity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Powerful aftershocks continued to rock the country, including one Sunday with a magnitude of 6.2 that originated in the sea, about 111 miles (179 kilometers) east of Tokyo. It swayed buildings in the capital, but there were no reports of injuries or damage. ||||| NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, flashed instructions to evacuees: close doors and windows; place a wet towel over the nose and mouth; cover up as much as possible. At a news conference, Mr. Edano called for calm. “If measures can be taken, we will be able to ensure the safety of the reactor,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One result of the venting may have been setting off an explosion, caused by either steam or hydrogen, that tore the outer wall and roof off the building housing reactor No. 1, although the steel containment of the reactor remained in place, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even before the statement on Sunday by Mr. Edano, it was clear form radioactive materials turning up in trace amounts outside the reactors that fuel damage had occurred. The existence or extent of melting might not be clear until workers can open up the reactors and examine the fuel, which could be months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A meltdown occurs when there is insufficient cooling of the reactor core, and it is the most dangerous kind of a nuclear power accident because of the risk of radiation releases. The radiation levels reported so far by the Japanese authorities are far above normal but still too small to pose a hazard to human health if the exposure continued for a brief period. The fear was that more core damage would bring bigger releases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said that as many as 160 people may have been exposed to radiation around the plant, and Japanese news media said that three workers at the facility were suffering from full-on radiation sickness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even before the explosion on Saturday, officials said they had detected radioactive cesium, which is created when uranium fuel is split, an indication that some of the nuclear fuel in the reactor was already damaged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How much damage the fuel suffered remained uncertain, though safety officials insisted repeatedly through the day that radiation leaks outside the plant remained small and did not pose a major health risk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, they also told the International Atomic Energy Agency that they were making preparations to distribute iodine, which helps protect the thyroid gland from radiation exposure, to people living near Daiichi and Daini. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worries about the safety of the two plants worsened on Saturday because executives of the company that runs them, Tokyo Electric Power, and government officials gave confusing accounts of the location and causes of the dramatic midday explosion and the damage it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late Saturday night, officials said that the explosion at Daiichi occurred in a structure housing turbines near its No. 1 reactor at the plant, rather than inside the reactor itself. But photographs of the damage did not make clear that this was the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They said that the blast, which may have been caused by a sharp buildup of hydrogen when the reactor’s cooling system failed, destroyed the concrete structure surrounding the reactor but did not collapse the critical steel container inside. This pattern of damage cast doubt on the idea that the explosion was in the turbine building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve confirmed that the reactor container was not damaged,” Mr. Edano said in a news conference on Saturday night. “The explosion didn’t occur inside the reactor container. As such there was no large amount of radiation leakage outside. At this point, there has been no major change to the level of radiation leakage outside, so we’d like everyone to respond calmly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japanese nuclear safety officials and international experts said that because of crucial design differences, the release of radiation at Daiichi would most likely be much smaller than at Chernobyl even if the plant had a complete core meltdown, which they said it had not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a full day of worries about the radiation leaking at Daiichi, Tokyo Electric Power said an explosion occurred “near” the No. 1 reactor at Daiichi around 3:40 p.m. Japan time on Saturday. It said four of its workers were injured in the blast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision to flood the reactor core with corrosive seawater, experts said, was an indication that Tokyo Electric Power and Japanese authorities had probably decided to scrap the plant. “This plant is almost 40 years old, and now it’s over for that place,” said Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector for the I.A.E.A., and now a visiting scholar at Harvard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Heinonen lived in Japan in the 1980s, monitoring its nuclear industry, and visited the stricken plant many times. Based on the reports he was seeing, he said he believed that the explosion was caused by a hydrogen formation, which could have begun inside the reactor core. “Now, every hour they gain in keeping the reactor cooling down is crucial,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he was also concerned about the presence of spent nuclear fuel in a pool inside the same reactor building. The pool, too, needs to remain full of water to suppress gamma radiation and prevent the old fuel from melting. If the spent fuel is also exposed — and so far there are only sketchy reports about the condition of that building — it could also pose a significant risk to the workers trying to prevent a meltdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Daiichi and Daini were shut down by Friday’s earthquake, but the loss of power in the area and damage to the plants’ generators from the ensuing tsunami crippled the cooling systems. Those are crucial after a shutdown to cool down the nuclear fuel rods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The malfunctions allowed pressure to build up beyond the design capacity of the reactors. Early Saturday, officials had said that small amounts of radioactive vapor were expected to be released into the atmosphere to prevent damage to the containment systems and that they were evacuating people in the area as a precaution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those releases apparently did not prevent the buildup of hydrogen inside the plant, which ignited and exploded Saturday afternoon, government officials said. They said the explosion itself did not increase the amount of radioactive material being released into the atmosphere. However, safety officials urged people who were not evacuating but still lived relatively nearby to cover their mouths and stay indoors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Lochbaum, who worked at three reactors in the United States with designs similar to Daiichi, and who was later hired by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to teach its personnel about that technology, said that judging by photographs of the stricken plant, the explosion appeared to have occurred in the turbine hall, not the reactor vessel or the containment that surrounds the vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Daiichi reactor is a boiling-water reactor. Inside the containment, the reactor sends its steam out to a turbine. The turbine converts the steam’s energy into rotary motion, which turns a generator and makes electricity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as the water goes through the reactor, some water molecules break up into hydrogen and oxygen. A system in the turbine hall usually scrubs out those gases. Hydrogen is also used in the turbine hall to cool the electric generator. Hydrogen from both sources has sometimes escaped and exploded, Mr. Lochbaum said, but in this case, there is an additional source of hydrogen: interaction of steam with the metal of the fuel rods. Operators may have vented that hydrogen into the turbine hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Saturday, before the explosion, a Japanese nuclear safety panel said the radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room at Daiichi. Some radioactive material had also seeped outside, with radiation levels near the main gate measured at eight times normal levels, NHK quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emergency at Daiichi began shortly after the earthquake struck Friday afternoon. Emergency diesel generators, which kicked in to run the cooling system after the electrical power grid failed, shut down about an hour after the earthquake. There was speculation that the tsunami had flooded the generators, knocking them out of service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For some time, the plant was able to operate in a battery-controlled cooling mode. Tokyo Electric Power said that by Saturday morning it had also installed a mobile generator to ensure that the cooling system would continue operating even after reserve battery power was depleted. Even so, the company said it needed to conduct “controlled containment venting” in order to avoid an “uncontrolled rupture and damage” to the containment unit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why the controlled release of pressure did not succeed in addressing the problem was not immediately explained. Tokyo Electric Power and government nuclear safety officials also did not explain the precise sequence of failures at the plant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daiichi and other nuclear facilities are designed with extensive backup systems that are supposed to function in emergencies to ensure the plants can be shut down safely. ||||| Shirakawa, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese authorities are operating on the presumption that possible meltdowns are under way at two nuclear reactors, a government official said Sunday, adding that there have been no indications yet of hazardous emissions of radioactive material into the atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attempts to avert a possible nuclear crisis, centered around the Fukushima Daiichi facility in northeast Japan, came as rescuers frantically scrambled to find survivors following the country's strongest-ever earthquake and a devastating tsunami that, minutes later, brought crushing walls of water that wiped out nearly everything in their paths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters there is a \"possibility\" of a meltdown at the plant's No. 1 reactor, adding, \"It is inside the reactor. We can't see.\" He then added that authorities are also \"assuming the possibility of a meltdown\" at the facility's No. 3 reactor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A meltdown is a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The efforts to control the temperature of atomic material, by pumping in sea water and boron, are taking place at the same facility where four were hurt late Saturday in an explosion. Edano said only a \"minor level\" of radiation has been released into the environment -- saying it all came from a controlled release of radioactive steam, insisting there have been no leaks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We do not believe it is harmful to human health,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 180,000 people are being evacuated from within 10 to 20 kilometers (6 to 12 miles) of the Daiichi plant -- which is in addition to the thousands that have already been taken away who live closer by. More than 30,000 more people were being evacuated from their homes within 10 kilometers of the Fukushima Daiini nuclear facility located in the same prefecture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news of the possible meltdowns came as rescue efforts resumed Sunday morning in areas devastated by the 8.9-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami, which unleashed a wall of seawater that decimated entire neighborhoods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rescuers dug through mud and rubble to find the buried, both alive and dead. Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan said more than 3,000 people have been rescued, according to the nation's Kyodo News Agency, some of them plucked from collapsed homes, muddy water and burning debris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the official death toll from Japan's National Police Agency was at 763, with 639 missing and 1,419 people injured. The actual toll is thought to be much higher, with Japanese public broadcaster NHK reporting more than 900 dead and Kyodo News Agency saying the death toll could top 1,800. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number is expected to rise as rescuers reach more hard-hit areas. In one coastal town alone -- Minamisanriku, in Myagi Prefecture -- some 9,500 people, half the town's population, were unaccounted for, Kyodo reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With most stores and gas stations closed, a main task for many in the hardest-hit areas Sunday morning was getting by -- and, in some cases, getting out. Scores lined up at the few gas stations, drug stores and grocery stores that had opened, with the shelves largely empty amid the rush to get food and the difficulty in restocking it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also braved an seemingly endless barrage of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey reported more than 140 such quakes -- magnitude 4.5 and higher, including a 6.2-magnitude quake just before 10:30 a.m. Sunday -- in, near or off of the east coast of the Japanese island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friday's quake was centered about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from Sendai. The city, with a population of about a million, is located in a farming region already battling youth population losses to big cities, leaving aging residents struggling to keep up with the global economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While there was little visible damage in that city, the devastation -- most of it caused by the tsunami, which reached several miles inland -- was readily apparent in coastal areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the city of Shirakawa, south of Sendai, rescuers dug through rubble with shovels to try to reach 13 neighbors trapped when the earth opened up and swallowed their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Relatives and friends stood in the cold, with temperatures near freezing overnight, quietly watching, praying and waiting. Others wept. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other affected areas, military choppers plucked people from rooftops. In some cases, rescuers trudged in muddy water, carrying survivors on their backs. Weary, mud-spattered residents wandered through streets filled with crumpled cars and other debris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, millions more around Japan were dealing with other repurcussions of Friday's quake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The quake disrupted rail service and affected air travel. Flight cancellations left at least 23,000 people stranded in two Tokyo airports, Kyodo said. Departing and arriving flights resumed Saturday. Limited rail service also was back in operation Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tokyo's Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea will close for 10 days, Kyodo News Agency reported, one of a host of closings, cancellations and other disruptions in the quake's aftermath. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 2.5 million households -- just over 4% of the total in Japan -- were without electricity Sunday, according to Fujisaki, the nation's U.S. ambassador. This marks a steep drop from the previous number, when 6 million households had no power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A desire to conserve power prompted decisions to turn off lights Saturday at a host of landmarks all around Japan -- some of them hundreds of miles from the main quake's epicenter, like the Tsutenkaku Tower in Osaka, Tokyo Tower and Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo, and Bay Bridge in Yokohama, the Kyodo News Agency reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan plans to dispatch 100,000 members of its Self-Defense Forces to the quake-ravaged region -- double the previous number -- Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said Sunday, according to the Kyodo News Agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan's government also has made a formal request for U.S.aid, including military support, and full planning for deployment is in effect, with the U.S. military in Japan taking the lead, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley with U.S. Forces Japan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, along with a guided-missile cruiser and destroyer ship, arrived off Japan's coast Sunday morning to support Japanese forces in disaster relief operations, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Agency for International Development has sent two search and rescue teams, from Virginia and California. Those teams, of about 150 people and 12 rescue dogs trained to find survivors, were expected to arrive Sunday morning and immediately begin working alongside Japanese and international teams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 48 other countries and the European Union also have offered relief to Japan, and supplies and personnel are already on the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The quake was the latest in a series around Japan last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, the country's meteorological agency said. Early Thursday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 struck off the same coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friday's quake is the strongest earthquake in recorded history to hit Japan, according to U.S. Geologic Survey records that date to 1900. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The world's largest recorded quake took place in Chile on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the USGS said.

Al Franken took to the Senate floor Thursday for a final farewell, surrounded by some of the same colleagues who demanded his resignation just weeks before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Even in the face of everything that is happening today, I still believe in Paul [Wellstone’s] words: ‘Politics is about the improvement of people’s lives,’ ” said Franken, who will officially resign Jan. 2 after more than eight years in the Senate. He agreed to step down, reluctantly and only after pressure from political allies, after several women accused him of trying to grope, kiss or harass them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Franken’s initial resignation announcement, which came on Dec. 7, was followed by the Senate version of a Long Minnesota Goodbye. For weeks, Franken continued to cast votes and tend to committee business while Gov. Mark Dayton selected a replacement appointee in Lt. Gov. Tina Smith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again and again, Franken returned to the Senate floor to deliver parting speeches on a range of topics that both summed up his core political values and tried to leave his constituents with a reminder of the statesman he had tried to be — not the guy grinning out of an 11-year-old photo with his hands reaching toward a sleeping woman’s breasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Franken talked about education policy, net neutrality, school bullying, the Trump administration and the eight years it took to secure federal funding to replace one crumbling high school on the Leech Lake Reservation. He talked about his bedrock belief that government can be a force for good. He talked about his family, his constituents and Wellstone, his political mentor and the person who held the same Senate seat from 1991 until his death in a plane crash in 2002. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Franken — author of books with titles like “Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them” — made his case for keeping politics combative, at least when it comes to battling a presidential administration he accused of lying about issues ranging from health care to voting rights.

I get why people want us to stop arguing and start, well, doing stuff,” he said. “But since I am leaving the Senate, I thought I would take a big risk and say a few words in favor of arguments.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the end of Franken’s half-hour address, his colleagues made their own goodbyes. First to speak was fellow Minnesota Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Smiling wistfully, she described Franken’s entry into the Senate: a former comedian trying to shake both the “No Joke” headlines and fellow senators who kept trying to test their wisecracks on him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When Al leaves here, he will not be quieted in any way. His work will live on, his voice will be stronger than ever,” Klobuchar said. “That last call of action that he left us with, for a war for truth … and truth in our politics, is something no one should forget in this chamber.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., joined the majority of the Democratic caucus in calling for Franken’s resignation earlier this month. Nevertheless, he said, Franken “has been a credit to the United States Senate, a passionate advocate for his home state of Minnesota, a defender of our Constitution and a determined fighter for justice. He became a better senator every year.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m sorry that he’s leaving under these circumstances,” Durbin said. “Every person who has ever lived has had moments they wish they could erase and words they wish they could take back.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Franken, whose Senate career was defined by his fight for women’s rights — including enthusiastic support for women who began speaking out this year about their abuse at the hands of powerful men — was brought down by a series of accusations from women who say he put his hands on their buttocks or breasts while they posed with him for photos, or that he made other uncomfortable advances on them during encounters before and during his Senate career. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite Franken’s repeated apologies and his call for a Senate ethics investigation into the allegations, by the time a seventh woman described an inappropriate encounter, his political allies lost patience. More than two dozen Senate Democrats, along with many allies back in Minnesota, called on him publicly to resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Franken’s Senate career was winding down, the Senate was gearing up for one last series of votes in an effort to keep the federal government funded and open at least into January.

{"context": "Two of the most well known portraits of Anne Boleyn, which are on display at the National Portrait Gallery, may not be her, scientists have concluded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facial recognition experts have created a computer algorithm which maps the faces from portraits to find a match with other paintings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They used a contemporaneous miniature of Boleyn from the British Museum as a reference, as it is the only undisputed likeness of Henry VIII’s second wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After running the software, the experts said they could not be sure that the ‘Anna Bolina’ portrait, a late 16th century copy of a painting from 1533, which hangs in London’s National Portrait Gallery, was the queen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Likewise, the Hever Castle portrait, a late 16th century painting which is a copy of a portrait from Tudor England, did not match other pictures of the queen and neither did a second picture of Boleyn from the National Portrait Gallery, even though the woman is wearing her signature ‘B’ pendant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many original portraits of Boleyn were destroyed after her execution in 1536 for fear of upsetting the King, but when Elizabeth I became queen it became fashionable again to hang pictures of her mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However because so few remained, it is thought that portraits of other noblewomen who bore a resemblance were relabelled and new details painted on to resemble Boleyn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Amit Roy-Chowdhury, of the University of California, created the algorithm after being approached by a history student who was keen to see if facial recognition technology could be applied to art history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof Chowdhury said: “The goal of this project is to be able to use state of the art face recognition to identify the individuals seen in a particular portrait. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These portraits have some importance. They probably represent someone of social standing, or some important event, and we often want to identify who is the person in the portrait. The goal is to be able to identify individuals whose identities may not be absolutely certain.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The technology also appears to have cleared up the mystery of the Nidd Hall portrait, a painting labelled as Anne Boleyn, but which many historians believed actually depicted Jane Seymour, Henry’s third wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The image shows a young woman in a gable hood, wearing a brooch bearing the initials ‘AB’ which was known to belong to Boleyn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The portrait was labelled as “The Most Excellent Princesse Anne Boleyn” but many historians claimed it was based a painting of Seymour by Holbein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However the new algorithm suggests there is match between the portrait and a 1.4 inch miniature of Boleyn known as ‘The Most Happi’ medal which is housed at The British Museum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The programme is so advanced that it even takes into account how individual painters like Holbein and Clouet represented certain facial characteristics, making allowances for artists’ style. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But while the software has cleared up one mystery, it may have opened the doors to several others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It revealed that two pictures of William Shakespeare are also unlikely to be the bard. The Cobbe portrait which dates from around 1610 is probably not the playwright. Historians have long speculated the painting may be poet Thomas Overbury. The Hampton Court Palace painting is also unlikely to be Shakespeare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cobbe Portrait of Shakespeare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However the research also identified the earliest picture ever painted of Galileo, which dates from 1590. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the software had also proved that Renaissance artists were sharing models. 'Lady with Primroses' which was sculpted by Verrocchio around 1475 was found to be Smerelda Brandini, the same woman painted by Botticelli in Portrait of a Lady at the Window, which hangs in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However Prof Chowdhury urged caution about the findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What the computer provides at the end is another source of evidence into the discussions that have been going on about these questions. It should not be construed that the computer knows the answer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in San Jose, California. ||||| London: A new chapter in the story of Anne Boleyn has been unveiled, thanks to facial recognition technology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry VIII's attempt to erase his second wife from history after chopping off her head may have been thwarted after more than 470 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts say the Nidd Hall portrait seems to be a genuine portrait of Anne Boleyn. Credit:Wikipedia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At present, the only undisputed portrait of the queen has been an image stamped into a four-centimetre-wide lump of lead held in the British Museum known as The Moost Happi medal. Other supposed paintings have courted controversy with experts disagreeing about their authenticity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now computer technology has highlighted one picture, the Nidd Hall portrait, which seems to be a genuine painting of Anne – even though it was previously thought by some to depict another of Henry's wives, Jane Seymour. ||||| She won the heart of King Henry VIII, divided the church and lost her head. But nearly 500 years after Anne Boleyn met her death, only one uncontested portrait of her remains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pictures of the beguiling queen – who is played by a steely Claire Foy in the hit BBC historical drama Wolf Hall – were roundly destroyed after her death in 1536. The concerted effort to erase her from history was thorough, leaving only a battered lead disc as a contemporary likeness, the Moost Happi medal in the British Museum in London.

Researchers in California used state-of-the-art face recognition to compare the face on the Moost Happi medal with a number of paintings and found a close match with the privately owned Nidd Hall portrait, held at the Bradford Art Galleries and Museums. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Nidd Hall artwork shows a woman wearing jewellery long thought to be Boleyn’s. But scholars have been divided on the figure’s identity. Some claim the woman is Boleyn’s successor, Jane Seymour, the third wife of King Henry VIII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amit Roy-Chowdhury, head of the video computing group at the University of California in Riverside, turned his expertise in computer face-recognition to renaissance art after he was asked for help by an art historian, Conrad Rudolph, a colleague at the university. “I had no idea about what art history really was,” he said. “My last interaction with art was probably some time in middle school.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three years later, Roy-Chowdhury has developed a program that learns to identify faces from their anatomical dimensions, such as the width of their noses, and the distance between their eyes, and more distinctive features, such as whether they have one straight eyebrow and one curved. After training the computer on pictures of known people, it can scan images of unknown characters and churn out probabilities on their identities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lead Moost Happi medal, believed to be a commemorative coin and the only undisputed image of Anne Boleyn NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using computers to recognise faces in old paintings is more challenging than picking out faces in a crowd. Facial recognition struggles with changes in pose, illumination, facial expressions and ageing. But in works of art, the computer must contend with the quirks of the artists’ styles. Another major hurdle is that often, precious few contemporary paintings exist on which to train the computer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To improve its chances of finding a match, the program works out the best combination of facial measurements and discriminating features with which to look for matches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose, Roy-Chowdhury described his program’s attempts to identify characters in a collection of 57 paintings. The program found 14 matches, and was undecided on the identity of 26 people. The rest were not the characters Roy-Chowdhury had programmed the computer to look for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reproduction of a portrait of Anne Boleyn in the National Portrait Gallery. Photograph: Roger-Viollet/Rex Features NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The system compared the Moost Happi medal image with four paintings from Tudor times, and failed to find a match with two portraits, including one from Hever Castle in Kent and another held at the National Portrait Gallery in London. More intriguingly, the system found what may be the earliest portrait of the astronomer Galileo Galilei. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These portraits have some importance.

The 17th-century Italian painter, Caravaggio, allegedly gave one of the figures in his altarpiece The Entombment of Christ the features of Michelangelo. But the computer found no matches when it compared the figure, Nicodemus, with bronze busts and a chalk drawing of Michelangelo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Italian, the 15th-century artist Andrea Mantegna, painted a self-portrait, but may also have worked his image into some of his most famous works. But comparisons of his self-portrait with two prominent works found no evidence he had.

{"context": "President Trump handed Russian President Vladimir Putin an unalloyed diplomatic triumph during their summit here Monday as he refused to support the collective conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s warm rhetorical embrace of Putin, who he said had given him an “extremely strong and powerful” denial that Russia assaulted U.S. democracy, marked an extraordinary capstone to the first formal meeting between the current leaders of the world’s nuclear superpowers and sparked trepidation and horror among many in Washington and around the globe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a remarkable 46-minute joint news conference inside the Finnish presidential palace, Trump would not challenge Putin’s claim that the Russian government played no role in trying to sabotage the U.S. election, despite the Justice Department’s indictments Friday of 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratic emails as part of a broad subterfuge operation to help Trump win the election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump went on to condemn the expansive federal investigation of Russian interference as “a disaster for our country” and “a total witch hunt,” arguing that the probe, along with “foolish” American policies, had severely impaired relations between the two countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gathering along the glistening waterfront of this Nordic capital turned into a clear political victory for the Russian president, who aims to expand his country’s global influence by sowing discord within the United States and disrupting Western alliances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the summit “fabulous” and “better than super,” according to Russian news agencies, while Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was snickering with exuberance as he watched the news conference from the sidelines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump and Putin spent their first two hours speaking alone, joined only by their interpreters. After emerging from the tete-a-tete with the former KGB agent, Trump appeared to discount the findings of his own intelligence agencies about Russia’s behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both presidents are highly focused on projecting dominance and machismo, but Trump on Monday waffled beside a stone-faced Putin and avoided a confrontation when an Associated Press reporter asked Trump whether he believes U.S. intelligence officials or Putin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They said they think it’s Russia,” Trump replied, referring to intelligence officials. “I have President Putin — he just said it’s not Russia.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump added: “I will say this — I don’t see any reason why it would be. . . . I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump declined an invitation by the AP reporter, Jonathan Lemire, to warn Putin, with the world watching, never again to interfere in a U.S. election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And with Trump looking on, Putin insisted to reporters that “the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Putin suggested what Trump described as an “interesting idea” — that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators could come to Russia and help question the dozen Russian suspects, as long as Russians could do the same of U.S. intelligence agents whom Moscow suspects of carrying out crimes on Russian soil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [After being told of Russia indictments, Trump still aspired to be friends with Putin] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s failure to confront Putin drew stern rebukes from leaders of both political parties in Washington and left the American national security establishment alarmed and dismayed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats responded by stating that the intelligence assessment of Russia’s “ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy” has been clear and has been presented to Trump in an unvarnished and objective fashion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former CIA director John O. Brennan tweeted that Trump proved himself to be “wholly in the pocket of Putin” and that his comments were “nothing short of treasonous.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said “there is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called the Helsinki summit “a tragic mistake,” arguing that Trump delivered “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the few defenses in Washington came from Vice President Pence. “What the world saw, what the American people saw, is that President Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first,” Pence said during an event at the Commerce Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Trump returned to Washington aboard Air Force One, the president took to Twitter to defend his performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As I said today and many times before, ‘I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.’ However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past — as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!” wrote the president, who has remained fixated on the exploits of his campaign two years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For three straight days leading up to the summit, Trump vented on Twitter and stewed in private with advisers over the indictments of a dozen Russian intelligence officers. The probe, overseen by Mueller, has produced charges against or guilty pleas from 32 Russians and Americans, including charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is in jail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discussing the investigation here Monday with Putin at his side, Trump insisted that there had been no coordination between his campaign and Moscow, using as his argument that he had no relationship with Putin at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I didn’t know the president,” Trump said. “There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump went on to air many of his pet grievances, including unsubstantiated conspiracy theories familiar to his campaign rally crowds and Twitter followers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the [Democratic National Committee]?” Trump asked. “Where are those servers? They’re missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton’s emails? Thirty-three thousand emails gone — just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn’t be gone so easily. I think it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 emails.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Putin confirmed that he wanted Trump to defeat Clinton “because he talked about normalizing relations” between Russia and the United States. When asked whether the Russian government had compromising information on Trump or his family members, Putin did not answer directly and dismissed the question by saying, “It’s hard to imagine greater nonsense.” He told reporters, “Please throw this junk out of your head.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the morning hours before the summit began, Trump said his own country, rather than Russia, was to blame for the hostilities between their two nations. Although most U.S. officials fault Russia’s election interference, its alleged use of a nerve agent on British soil and its aggression in Ukraine and Syria, Trump instead faulted “U.S. foolishness and stupidity” in a tweet. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Twitter account retweeted it and added, “We agree.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After sitting down with Putin, Trump said relations had warmed — and Putin agreed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Cold War is a thing of the past,” Putin said, saying that he and Trump spoke “in a frank and businesslike atmosphere.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a show of bonhomie, Putin, who hosted the World Cup soccer tournament that concluded Sunday in Moscow, handed Trump a souvenir soccer ball. “Now the ball is in your court,” Putin said. The United States, Canada and Mexico will jointly host the World Cup in 2026, after Qatar in 2022. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump tossed the ball to first lady Melania Trump, who was sitting in the front row at the news conference, and said they would give it to their son, Barron, 12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was critical of Trump’s performance Monday, tweeted, “If it were me, I’d check the soccer ball for listening devices and never allow it in the White House.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump-Putin summit began later than originally planned, after the perennially tardy Russian president arrived in Helsinki well behind schedule, keeping Trump waiting. Their one-on-one meeting lasted about two hours, a half-hour longer than anticipated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Putin’s Helsinki showmanship starts with his limo] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Helsinki, which sits across the Gulf of Finland from Putin’s hometown of St. Petersburg, has hosted past diplomatic breakthroughs between American and Russian presidents because of Finland’s stance of political neutrality. Although a member of the European Union, Finland is not part of NATO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Monday’s summit here produced no such breakthrough. Trump and Putin said they discussed a range of issues — including the civil war in Syria as well as terrorism and nuclear disarmament — but announced no substantive agreement at the conclusion of their discussions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heading into the summit, U.S. officials said the meeting itself was a “deliverable,” and Trump said there would be future talks between the two presidents and their delegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our relationship has never been worse than it is now,” Trump said as he stood alongside Putin at the summit’s conclusion. “However, that changed as of about four hours ago.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR William Branigin and John Wagner in Washington contributed to this report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, more than 1,500 years after the last fights between lions, leopards and bears, one of the ingenious wooden machines that carried the beasts to certain death has been reconstructed in the middle of the ancient Roman arena. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unveiled on Friday, the massive timber structure has been built amid the warren of tunnels and passageways that lay beneath the arena of the Colosseum, a fetid, torch-lit underworld of frightened animals, sweating slaves and gladiators waiting to do battle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It consists of a wooden cage which can be winched up to the arena floor with the help of a sophisticated system of ropes, pulleys and lead weights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A view of the underground passages of the Colosseum NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wild animals such as wolves and big cats would have been forced into the cage and hoisted upwards, emerging via trap doors in the centre of the arena to the delight of the emperor and 50,000 baying spectators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It took a year and a half to build the 23ft-high timber lift, using only materials that would have been available to the ancient Romans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A documentary was made of the project, during which a full-grown male wolf was put in the cage and released into the middle of the amphitheatre. But instead of being put to death with a gladiator's sword or the horns of a bull, it was rewarded with a biscuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was the first time that a wild animal had been released into the Colosseum in 1,500 years,\" said Gary Glassman, the American director who made the documentary, which is likely to be shown in Britain later this year.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Animals such as deer, antelope, wild boar and ostriches were despatched by trained hunters known in Latin as \"venatores\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The beasts, which included elephants and rhinoceroses captured in Africa, were prodded into action by handlers known as \"bestiarii\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lift was constructed from timber felled in the Sabina mountains north of Rome.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Romans built a total of 28 such elevators in the bowels of the amphitheatre, from which wild animals would spring out in front of gladiators and hunters, to their surprise and terror. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The modern-day machine was based on remaining clues in the tunnel network, including bronze fittings, holes carved for timber posts and rope marks that can still be seen in the stone.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tens of thousands of wild animals are believed to have been sacrificed in the Colosseum over four centuries, fighting each other, gladiators or common criminals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The amphitheatre was officially opened under Emperor Titus in AD80 in \"an extravaganza of fighting, beast hunts and bloodshed that is said to have lasted a hundred days,\" the historian Mary Beard writes in her book The Colosseum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pompey, a general who was later defeated by Julius Caesar, laid on a spectacle in the first century BC in which 20 elephants, 600 lions and 410 leopards are said to have been killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emperor Commodus, who sometimes fought in the arena, killed five hippos, two elephants, a rhino and a giraffe, according to contemporary accounts from the second century AD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Romans also unleashed wild animals on prisoners and criminals, in a grisly ritual known as 'damnatio ad bestias' where the victims, some tied to stakes, were mauled and eaten by the animals. ||||| Now, the thrilling, bloodthirsty history of gladiatorial combat has been brought to life after archaeologists reconstructed one of the ingenious machines that hoisted wild animals into the Colosseum in Rome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The structure, unveiled on Friday in the huge, partially-ruined amphitheatre, features a sophisticated pulley-based lift and trapdoor system and would have been used to carry lions, leopards and bears to be slain in the ancient arena.

{"context": "Importance Marijuana use is increasingly common in the United States. It is unclear whether it has long-term effects on memory and other domains of cognitive function. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Objective To study the association between cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana use and cognitive performance in middle age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Design, Setting, and Participants We used data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a cohort of 5115 black and white men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986 (year 0), and followed up over 25 years from June 7, 1986, to August 31, 2011, to estimate cumulative years of exposure to marijuana (1 year = 365 days of marijuana use) using repeated measures and to assess associations with cognitive function at year 25. Linear regression was used to adjust for demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, tobacco smoking, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, physical activity, depression, and results of the mirror star tracing test (a measure of cognitive function) at year 2. Data analysis was conducted from June 7, 1986, to August 31, 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Main Outcomes and Measures Three domains of cognitive function were assessed at year 25 using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (processing speed), and the Stroop Interference Test (executive function). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results Among 3385 participants with cognitive function measurements at the year 25 visit, 2852 (84.3%) reported past marijuana use, but only 392 (11.6%) continued to use marijuana into middle age. Current use of marijuana was associated with worse verbal memory and processing speed; cumulative lifetime exposure was associated with worse performance in all 3 domains of cognitive function. After excluding current users and adjusting for potential confounders, cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana remained significantly associated with worse verbal memory. For each 5 years of past exposure, verbal memory was 0.13 standardized units lower (95% CI, −0.24 to −0.02; P = .02), corresponding to a mean of 1 of 2 participants remembering 1 word fewer from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use. After adjustment, we found no associations with lower executive function (–0.03 [95% CI, −0.12 to 0.07]; P = .56) or processing speed (–0.04 [95% CI, −0.16 to 0.08]; P = .51). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusions and Relevance Past exposure to marijuana is associated with worse verbal memory but does not appear to affect other domains of cognitive function. ||||| NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is probably too much marijuana for one person. (Seth Perlman/Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New research published today in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine confirms what many of us have suspected for some time: If you smoke a lot of weed — like a lot of it — it can potentially do permanent damage to your short-term memory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Reto Auer of the University of Lausanne led a team of researchers who examined data on the marijuana habits of nearly 3,400 Americans over a 25-year period. At the end of the study period, the subjects took a battery of tests designed to assess cognitive abilities — memory, focus, ability to make quick decisions, etc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study found that people who smoked marijuana on a daily basis for a long period of time — five years or more — had poorer verbal memory in middle age than people who didn't smoke, or who smoked less. This association remained even after researchers controlled for a variety of other factors known to affect cognitive performance, including age, education, use of other substances and depression. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Auer and his team measured lifetime marijuana exposure in a fantastic new unit of measurement they call \"marijuana-years.\" Essentially, if you smoke pot every day for a year, that equals one marijuana-year of use. Ditto if you smoke every other day for two years, or once a week for seven years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Scientists have found that smoking weed does not make you stupid after all] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of Feb. 26, 2015 marijuana was made legal in D.C.—sort of. Here are the ins and outs of the complex pot law. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The relationship between marijuana exposure and memory problems was essentially linear. The more pot people smoked, the worse they performed on the memory tests. But just how much worse? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's say we have two groups of 10 people each. You tell each of them a list of 15 words and ask them to memorize them. Then 25 minutes later, you ask them to recall all of the words to the best of their ability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first group consists of 10 people who don't smoke pot or only do so occasionally. Let's say on average, people in this group would be able to remember nine out of the 15 words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second group consists of people who smoked pot every single day over a period of five years. On average, they'd be able to recall 8.5 out of the 15 words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That doesn't seem like a huge cognitive difference, and by and large it's not. But multiply that by every five marijuana years of exposure and the gap can start to get larger. For instance, say you had a group of people who smoked weed literally every single day from age 20 until they turned 45. At age 45, you'd expect these folks to remember, on average, 2.5 fewer words as a comparable group who had smoked occasionally or not at all over the same period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Few people actually smoke this much pot. Among the 3,385 study subjects, only 311 (8 percent) had more than five marijuana-years of exposure. But many drug policy experts are concerned that legalizing marijuana and making it easier to get will cause rates of heavy, problematic use like this to rise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One important caveat is that a study like this can't determine causality. It could be the case that heavy pot use makes your short-term memory bad, or it could be that people who operate at a lower level of cognitive function are more inclined to use marijuana heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's also worth noting that the other cognitive abilities researchers tested — focus and processing speed — did not seem to be significantly impacted by heavy marijuana use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [The case for marijuana legalization just got stronger] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The association between short-term memory declines — potentially permanent ones — and heavy pot use is very real, according to this study, and shouldn't be discounted. On the other hand, it's also quite surprising that you can smoke weed every single day for five years, and not have it impact your problem-solving abilities or your ability to focus at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These findings also need to be understood in relation to what we know about the severe cognitive effects of persistent, heavy alcohol use, which include irreversible brain damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall, the take-home message is one of moderation. Whether your preferred vice is pot or alcohol or gambling or Big Macs, it stands to reason that if you overdo it, you're going to hurt yourself.

This is the challenge now facing health officials hoping to inform and warn the public about an increasingly legal recreational drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new study indicates lifetime use of marijuana is linked to poorer verbal memory at middle age, and its authors want to spread the word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Young adults may be skeptical about advice on the putative adverse health effects of marijuana, which they may see as being overstated to justify the prohibition on its use,” wrote Dr. Wayne Hall, University of Queensland, Australia, and Dr. Michael Lynskey, Kings College London, in an editorial accompanying the new study. They say the challenge, then, is finding effective ways to inform pot smokers (and wannabe smokers) about the risks if they decide to smoke long-term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starting Age and Duration NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During 2012, roughly 37 percent of 12th grade American students reported using marijuana within the last year, 23 percent within the last 30 days, and 6.5 percent daily, the study authors explain. Meanwhile, past studies indicate heavy, long-term use is linked to mental impairment, particularly in learning and remembering new information, the researchers noted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what are the consequences of occasional use over the years? And how much do other factors matter, such as what age you are when you start? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Reto Auer, formerly of UC San Francisco and now of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and his co-researchers turned to National Institutes of Health-funded heart disease research to answer these questions. Repeatedly over 25 years, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study has measured marijuana use beginning in early adulthood among its participants. Because the study is not a laboratory experiment, CARDIA provides an opportunity to assess the long-term effects of the drug as used by people within a community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During year 25, the study measured participants' cognitive performance using standardized tests of verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function. Looking at the data for the total 3,499 participants, Auer and his colleagues discovered that nearly 97 percent had the necessary comparison data on cognitive function from earlier years in their files. Among these participants, about 84 percent had reported past marijuana use, while only about 11 percent continued to use marijuana into middle age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We used current and lifetime use to compute marijuana-years, with one year of exposure equivalent to 365 days of marijuana use,” wrote the researchers, who also factored participants’ use of other drugs, including tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, and antidepressants, into their calculations. Analyzing the data, the researchers discovered a relationship between cumulative lifetime use of cannabis and worsening verbal memory in middle age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Specifically, for each additional five marijuana-years of exposure, verbal memory was 0.13 standardized units lower than for those who never used it; this corresponds to a mean of one of two participants remembering one word fewer from a list of 15 words for every 5 years of use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We found no significant associations of cumulative exposure with executive function or processing speed,” wrote the researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In their accompanying editorial, Hall and Lynskey refer to a New Zealand study which assessed IQ at age 13 (pre-marijuana use) and again at age 38. Early initiators and persistent users showed the largest decline in IQ scores — 8 points compared to those who had never used or those who had used and then stopped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the new study provides some evidence to discourage early and regular marijuana use, Hall and Lynskey amplify this warning by noting that people who start young and continue to use are more likely to become dependent. And here, past research has shown that dependence on marijuana is linked to an increased risk of leaving school early, experiencing symptoms of psychosis, using other illicit drugs, developing depression and anxiety disorders, and receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hall W, Lynskey M. Long-Term Marijuana Use, Cognitive Impairment in Middle Age. JAMA Intern Med. 2016. ||||| Years of smoking pot may have an effect on a person's verbal memory, which is the ability to remember certain words, a new study finds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For every five years of marijuana use, researchers found that, on average, one out of two people remembered one word fewer from a list of 15 words, according to the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long-term use was not, however, significantly associated with decreases in other measures of cognitive function, such as processing speed or executive function, the researchers wrote in the study, published today (Feb. 1) in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Executive function includes skills such as planning and focusing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To examine the effects of long-term marijuana use, the researchers studied participants who were enrolled in the long-running Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The CARDIA study included more than 5,000 adults who initially enrolled in the study between ages 18 and 30. During a series of follow-up visits, the participants reported if they had used marijuana in the previous month. At the 25-year follow-up, the participants were given a series of cognitive tests that looked at verbal memory, processing speed and executive function. [11 Odd Facts About Marijuana] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While long-term marijuana use was associated with worse performance in all three tests, after the researchers adjusted for other factors (such as use of other substances and depression), they found that only the association between long-term use and verbal memory was statistically significant (meaning the associations between marijuana use and both processing speed and executive function may have been due to chance). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We found a dose-dependent independent association between cumulative lifetime exposure to marijuana and worsening verbal memory in middle age,\" the researchers wrote in the study. In other words, the more marijuana a person used, the greater the effects on verbal memory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers are not sure how marijuana exposure might affect verbal memory. One potential explanation is that THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol — the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects — may affect the way information is processed in the hippocampus, the researchers wrote in their study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers noted some limitations to the study, including that the marijuana use was self-reported and that the cognitive tests were only done once, at the end of the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because there were no baseline data available on cognitive abilities, it's more difficult to rule out the possibility that people with lower cognitive abilities were more likely to use marijuana, an editorial accompanying the study added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the findings fit well with other evidence on long-term use of marijuana and a decline in cognitive abilities, according to the editorial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, a long-running study in New Zealand found that adults who were longtime users of marijuana showed a larger decline in IQ scores compared with those who had never used marijuana or those who had stopped, the authors of the editorial wrote. (A study from earlier this year, however, found that marijuana use was not associated with a drop in IQ in teens). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, while it is not yet possible to prove cause and effect between marijuana use and a decline in cognitive abilities, both the researchers and the authors of the editorial agree that it is prudent to continue to warn potential users about the possible harms associated with the drug.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blaze is one of several Western wildfires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and South Dakota -- where authorities said a U.S. Air Force C-130 assisting in the firefighting effort crashed Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The aircraft crashed while fighting the White Draw Fire near Edgemont, South Dakota, the U.S. Northern Command said. No information was available about the crew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crash prompted the U.S. Air Force to ground all firefighting equipped C-130 planes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While hopes were high for further advances, fire crews were mindful of the possibility of erratic gusty winds that could cause a sudden and unpredictable outbreak, incident commander Rich Harvey told reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While crews work to put the fire out for good, investigators are scouring the burned-out landscape for clues to what started the now 17,920-acre fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI has joined agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as well as local authorities to investigate the cause of the fire that began in the early afternoon of June 23 in the Pike National Forest, about three miles west of Colorado Springs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While searching for her great-grandmother's cast-iron skillets, Moore marveled at the juxtaposition of what burned and what hadn't. \"To find my mail in my mailbox, unscathed. It's just unreal,\" she told The Associated Press by phone. \"Bird baths are fine. Some of the foliage is fine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than a week after it sparked on June 23, the Waldo Canyon fire was still being attacked by some 1,500 personnel. Crews working grueling shifts through the hot weekend made progress against the 28-square-mile fire, and authorities said they were confident they had built good fire lines in many areas to stop the spread of the flames. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blaze was now 55 percent contained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was just one of several still burning in the West, where parched conditions and heat contributed to the woes facing crews on hundreds of square miles across Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Colorado Springs, a line of cars a mile long queued up at a middle school checkpoint, where police checked the identification of returning residents and handed them water bottles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not far away from Moore's home, Bill Simmons and his wife, Debbie Byes, returned to their tri-level, passive-solar stucco home and found no damage _ just some ashes in the driveway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The water and electric's back on. You know, we're good to go,\" Simmons said by phone. \"We're feeling pretty sad for our neighbors and pretty lucky for ourselves.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The house across the street burned to its foundation. It had a shake shingle roof. A house next door with shake shingles appeared undamaged, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unburned landscaping around the destroyed house suggested to Simmons that a stray ember rather than advancing flames was to blame. In all, three houses in their immediate neighborhood burned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's crazy. The house across the street is burned to the foundation and the other side of the street is untouched,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More evacuation orders were being lifted, which will bring the total number of people who remain blocked from their homes down to 3,000 from more than 30,000 at the peak of the fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rich Harvey, incident commander for Waldo Canyon, said crews continue to make good progress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're cautiously optimistic,\" he said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cause of the fire, which so far has cost $8.8 million to battle, has not been determined. Dangerous conditions had kept authorities from beginning their inquiry, but investigators were able to start work on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A \"bear invasion\" confronted a few mountain enclaves west of Colorado Springs. The scent of trash had enticed black bears pushed out of their usual forest habitat by fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People who left in a hurry didn't take typical precautions to secure household trash against wildlife, said El Paso County Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Kramer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So that's become an attraction for the bears,\" Kramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State game officials were trying to shoo the bears out, he said, and Dumpsters were stationed to help volunteers and returning homeowners throw stuff out. Kramer didn't know how many bears were causing problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the fires elsewhere in the West: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ Utah: Fire commanders say Utah's largest wildfire has consumed more than 150 square miles and shows no sign of burning itself out. Hundreds of firefighters are trying to hold the Clay Springs fire from advancing on the ranching towns of Scipio and Mills on the edge of Utah's west desert. The fire has destroyed one summer home and threatens 75 others. The fire was 48 percent contained on Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ Montana: Strong winds and high temperatures helped a wildfire near Lame Deer to grow by nearly 10 percent Sunday to 265 square miles. Hundreds of firefighters are now at the lightning-caused Ash Creek complex that started Monday and have destroyed more than 30 structures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ Wyoming: Late Sunday night, authorities called for evacuations in an area of southern Albany County where a fast-growing wildfire was burning. The area is about 30 miles southwest of Laramie in the Medicine Bow National Forest area. It wasn't immediately clear how may residences are affected. The blaze is one of several burning through parched forest lands in Wyoming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR _ Idaho: Firefighters in eastern Idaho had the 1,038-acre Charlotte fire 80 percent contained Sunday but remained cautious with a forecast of high winds and hot temperatures that could put hundreds of homes at risk.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They won’t have anything you can order on Earth,” said MiceChat.com blogger Todd Regan, who writes under the pen name Dusty Sage. “It’s inside its own galaxy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision to break with tradition and sell alcohol to the public is a landmark one, because Walt Disney always opposed selling liquor in the world’s first theme park, which he wanted to be a wholesome, family-friendly experience. However, booze and cocktails have been big money-makers at Disneyland’s sister theme park, Disney California Adventure, which opened in 2001, where the cocktail menu even changes with the seasons. Starting next summer, visitors who want an adult beverage at Disneyland can find one inside the new Oga’s Cantina, among smugglers and aliens, from a special menu of proprietary beer, wine and outer-space-themed cocktails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Libations must be consumed inside the cantina only, leaving the rest of Disneyland alcohol-free, except for the park’s secretive private Club 33, which also offers liquor to its members. Kids drinks will also be available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge will be a completely immersive true-to-story experience,” park spokeswoman Liz Jaeger said Thursday. “Given our commitment to offering fans an immersive cantina experience, we felt this was an opportunity to offer alcohol and non-alcohol based beverages in the context of the story.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said that more specifics about the menu will be revealed as they are developed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new Star Wars land is being carved out of a portion of Frontierland, and will include two new dark rides as well as a themed planetary experience. It’s expected to open in summer 2019. Visitors can see construction that is well underway by standing on the roof of the Mickey & Friends parking garage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Oga’s Cantina is the kind of establishment that attracts some of the most interesting and disreputable characters in the galaxy,” lead designer and Disney Imagineer Scott Trowbridge said in a prepared statement. “And you never know when a stormtrooper or a familiar face will show up. Patrons of the cantina come from across the galaxy to sample the famous concoctions created with exotic ingredients using “otherworldly” methods, served in unique vessels. With choices for kids and libations for adults, the cantina will make for a great stop! “ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disney author David Koenig, who’s been predicting the move for months, said that the plan to sell liquor in the cantina wasn’t all that surprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The money in it was just too big,” Koenig said. “That was 100 percent of the decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 2016 analysis by BevSpot blog found that bars average 80 percent profit on their liquor sales, based on the cost of the ingredients, also known as the “pour cost.” With the high volume at Disneyland, the profit could be even higher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Disneyland blog described more details about the upcoming libations on its Disneyland News blog. “Patrons will come from across the galaxy to sample the famous concoctions created with exotic ingredients using “otherworldly” methods. These beverages will be served in unique vessels and guests will not be allowed to take alcoholic beverages outside of the cantina.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Koenig questioned how employees plan to keep the liquor inside its designated boundaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They don’t want people wandering around Fantasyland with beer and cocktails,” Koenig said, although he wondered when that policy might change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They have margarita stands at Disney California Adventure,” Koenig said. “If it works in the cantina, then don’t be surprised if the sale of alcohol springs up elsewhere.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staff writer Anne Valdespino contributed to this story. ||||| The National Prohibition Act, known informally as the Volstead Act, was enacted to carry out the intent of the 18th Amendment (ratified January 1919), which established prohibition in the United States. The Anti-Saloon League's Wayne Wheeler conceived and drafted the bill, which was named for Andrew Volstead, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who managed the legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Procedure [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the production, sale, and transport of \"intoxicating liquors,\" it did not define \"intoxicating liquors\" or provide penalties. It granted both the federal government and the states the power to enforce the ban by \"appropriate legislation.\" A bill to do so was introduced in Congress in 1919. Later this act was voided by the Twenty-first amendment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bill was vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson, largely on technical grounds because it also covered wartime prohibition, but his veto was overridden by the House on the same day, October 27, 1919, and by the Senate one day later.[9] The three distinct purposes of the Act were: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR to prohibit intoxicating beverages, to regulate the manufacture, sale, or transport of intoxicating liquor (but not consumption), and to ensure an ample supply of alcohol and promote its use in scientific research and in the development of fuel, dye, and other lawful industries and practices, such as religious rituals.[10] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It provided further that \"no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor except as authorized by this act.\" It did not specifically prohibit the use of intoxicating liquors. The act defined intoxicating liquor as any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume and superseded all existing prohibition laws in effect in states that had such legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enforcement and impact [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The production, importation, and distribution of alcoholic beverages — once the province of legitimate business — was taken over by criminal gangs, which fought each other for market control in violent confrontations, including murder. Major gangsters, such as Omaha's Tom Dennison and Chicago's Al Capone, became rich and were admired locally and nationally. Enforcement was difficult because the gangs became so rich they were often able to bribe underpaid and understaffed law enforcement personnel and pay for expensive lawyers. Many citizens were sympathetic to bootleggers, and respectable citizens were lured by the romance of illegal speakeasies, also called \"blind tigers.\" The loosening of social morals during the 1920s included popularizing the cocktail and the cocktail party among higher socio-economic groups. Those inclined to help authorities were often intimidated, even murdered. In several major cities — notably those that served as major points of liquor importation (including Chicago and Detroit) — gangs wielded significant political power. A Michigan State Police raid on Detroit's Deutsches Haus once netted the mayor, the sheriff, and the local congressman.[11] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prohibition came into force at midnight on January 17, 1920, and the first documented infringement of the Volstead Act occurred in Chicago on January 17 at 12:59 a.m. According to police reports, six armed men stole $100,000 worth of \"medicinal\" whiskey from two freight train cars. This trend in bootlegging liquor created a domino effect with criminals across the United States. Some gang leaders were stashing liquor months before the Volstead Act was enforced. The ability to sustain a lucrative business in bootlegging liquor was largely helped by the minimal police surveillance at the time. There were only 134 agents designated by the Prohibition Unit to cover all of Illinois, Iowa, and parts of Wisconsin.[12] According to Charles C. Fitzmorris, Chicago's Chief of Police during the beginning of the Prohibition period: \"Sixty percent of my police [were] in the bootleg business.\"[13] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Section 29 of the Act allowed 200 gallons (the equivalent of about 1000 750 ml bottles) of \"non-intoxicating cider and fruit juice\" to be made each year at home.[14] Initially \"intoxicating\" was defined as anything more than 0.5%,[15] but the Bureau of Internal Revenue soon struck that down[16] and this effectively legalized home wine-making.[14] For beer, however, the 0.5% limit remained until 1933. Some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home; Zinfandel grapes were popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, but its tight bunches left their thin skins vulnerable to rot, due to rubbing and abrasion, on the long journey to East Coast markets.[17] The thick skins of Alicante Bouschet were less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home wine-making market.[17][18] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Act contained a number of exceptions and exemptions. Many of these were used to evade the law's intended purpose. For example, the Act allowed a physician to prescribe whiskey for his patients but limited the amount that could be prescribed. Subsequently, the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association voted to submit to Congress a bill to remove the limit on the amount of whiskey that could be prescribed and questioned the ability of a legislature to determine the therapeutic value of any substance.[19] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Neely, \"The Act called for trials for anyone charged with an alcohol-related offense, and juries often failed to convict.[citation needed] Under the state of New York's Mullan–Gage Act, a short-lived local version of the Volstead Act, the first 4,000 arrests led to just six convictions and not one jail sentence\".[20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Repeal [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prohibition lost advocates as ignoring the law gained increasing social acceptance and as organized crime violence increased. By 1933, public opposition to prohibition had become overwhelming. In March of that year, Congress passed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which legalized \"3.2 beer\" (i.e., beer containing 3.2% alcohol by weight or 4% by volume) and wines of similarly low alcohol content, rather than the 0.5% limit defined by the original Volstead Act.[21] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress passed the Blaine Act, a proposed constitutional amendment to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment to end prohibition, in February. On December 5, 1933, Utah became the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, voiding the Volstead Act, and restored control of alcohol to the states. The creation of the Federal Alcohol Administration in 1935 defined a modest role for the federal government with respect to alcohol and its taxation.[citation needed] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See also [ edit ]"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney didn't simply get more votes than Santorum did in the \"must-win\" state of Wisconsin, he won over the kinds of voters who have been skeptical of his candidacy for much of this primary season: very conservative Republicans, middle income earners, strong Tea Party supporters and non-college graduates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get More News at ABC Politics and a Different Spin at OTUS News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be sure, Romney didn't exactly carry these groups by a wide margin - he won those making less than $100,00 per year by just one point and very conservatives by just three points.

He lost those who made less than $100,000 per year by 8 points.

But, he lost this group by 3 points in Wisconsin, a big improvement from Ohio where he lost them by 17 points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't to say that the entire GOP electorate is completely sold on Romney. Those who value a candidate who is \"true conservative\" or \"has a strong moral character\" continue to support Santorum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, when 83 percent of the Wisconsin electorate says they expect Romney to be the nominee, it's clear that voters not only see the light at the end of the long tunnel that has been the GOP primary, but they want the party to get there - now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Traveling around the state this weekend, ABC's Michael Falcone found lots of Republican voters who more than ready to see the primary contest come to an end. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The sooner we can get on to focusing on the real issues and bringing those to the American public as opposed to just constant back and forth fighting will be beneficial for the long term,\" said Ed Butte of Pewaukee, Wis., an undecided voter who stopped by a Sunday morning pancake breakfast to listen to Romney. \"Things are starting to align, so let's make a decision, let's move forward and get on with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, Ed, looks like your wish just came true. ||||| TheWashingtonPost After Wisconsin primary, Santorum's appeal is exhausted NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitt Romney's convincing win in Wisconsin means peace is settling upon the GOP and Romney is the candidate of conservatives. Santorum could still have a grip on some of our evangelicals and some who will not vote for a Mormon as their first choice in a primary, but there is no denying Romney's broad appeal.When Romney won Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wisc.) endorsement and talk radio turned in his favor in Wisconsin, it meant the conservatives were finally on board. The Maryland and DC primaries were never really contested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santorum’s appeal is exhausted. Nothing suggests that it is growing with any segment or demographic within the party. He can linger as background noise, but there is no purpose for his candidacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All this means that Romney needs two to four weeks to tidy up by bringing remaining elected party leaders on board, building a deeper campaign team and finding roles for Republican policy leaders. Then it’s game on with Obama. ||||| NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a town hall meeting in Milwaukee on April 2 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a young football fan, I learned that my team was doomed once the television announcers started to thank the producers, directors, and cameramen. They could interrupt the play-by-play because nothing was likely to happen on the field to spark the magical comeback I was hoping for. The opposing quarterback, untroubled by madness or sorcery, would take a knee, and the clock would run out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tonight, Mitt Romney swept the primaries in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, banking his 25th win out of 37 contests. He picked up 83 delegates to Rick Santorum's nine. (This figure has been updated. An earlier version reflected incomplete results.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This broadcast of the Republican nomination was produced by ... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Technically, there is still time on the clock—19 contests to go—and there are undoubtedly some Santorum fans in their knit caps and team jerseys hoping the game will turn around. But it’s over. Mitt Romney's rivals aren’t going to catch him. He is hundreds of delegates ahead and gaining more with every contest. In Wisconsin, according to exit polls, 8 out of 10 voters said Romney would be the eventual nominee. Even two-thirds of those who voted for Santorum agreed with that prediction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only consistent foe Mitt Romney has faced in the GOP primaries has been apathy. Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum have—at one time or another—carried the banner of the vocal minority that is uneasy with Romney, but none of them could build a big and durable enough coalition to beat him. These newest victories were merely a capstone on a move to rally behind Romney that has been underway since his big win in Illinois. Luminaries from all factions of the party have now called on Republicans to unite and turn their attention to beating Barack Obama. In the national Gallup poll, Romney is ahead of Santorum by 15 points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battle for the general election is escalating with Obama and Romney giving speeches that would still be pitch-perfect if they were given in October. The ad wars are heating up, too. This is the first week the president's campaign directly criticized Romney by name in an advertisement. No one with heft in the Republican side has stopped the stampede to say, “Hold on, let this primary play out.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With no rousing alternative to Romney, apathy was not enough to defeat him. Even as he approaches the finish line, excitement doesn’t seem to be building. His party is hoping that Obama’s record will hand Romney a victory. It’s a shaky platform on which Romney begins his general election campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney has two immediate repair jobs to do. He must unite his party, and he must heal his badly battered image with key voting blocs: independent voters, women, Hispanics, and the working class. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Santorum doesn’t get out and picks up some pyrrhic victories in the South, Romney could enter the general election with as many or more defeats than any other Republican nominee since Gerald Ford lost 23 primary contests to Ronald Reagan in 1976. Recent endorsements from Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Jim DeMint have helped close the door on the nominating process, but they have been of the kiss-and-run variety usually reserved for a game of spin the bottle. Sen. Marco Rubio told the Daily Caller, \"There are a lot of other people out there that some of us wish had run for president—but they didn't.” Conservative leader Al Cardenas recently wrote an op-ed backing Romney. He said the GOP primary was turning into an \"Are we there yet?\" car ride. This is not true of all of Romney’s endorsements, however. Some of his recent supporters actually seem like they want him to be president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, of the two repair jobs, that one is easier. Movement conservatives may be tepid about Mitt Romney, but they really dislike Barack Obama. And the president keeps reminding them why. His promise to Dmitri Medvedev that he will have \"more flexibility\" after the election suggests that he's willing to be more honest with our rivals than the American people. The president's campaign against Mitt Romney will revolve around the charge that Romney says whatever is convenient at the political moment. President Obama was telegraphing to the Russians that during election time he'll behave the same way. Profligate spending at the General Services Administration doesn’t hurt Romney’s campaign, either. That scandal will keep the Tea Party energized for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that might not be enough to help Romney. Mitt Romney needs to improve his lot with swing voters, and right now the polls suggest he's in the worst position of any candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992. Fifty-two percent of independent voters view Romney unfavorably, and only 35 percent view him favorably, according to a recent Washington Post poll. President Obama has a 50-46 favorable-to-unfavorable rating with independents. Among women, a key voting bloc, Obama has an 18 point lead over Romney in a recent USA Today/Gallup poll. Republican presidential candidates usually do worse with female voters, but this is suitcase-on-the-front-lawn bad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And women aren’t the only bad news for Mitt. A CNN survey showed Obama leading Romney 54 percent to 43 percent nationally, up five points from February. In the Gallup swing-state poll, he is up 51 to 42 over Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How does Romney fix all of this? He can pray that Obama stumbles and the economy stops improving. Another way is to mount some kind of Clinton-like comeback. That would require a set of political pirouettes that Mitt Romney has never shown the legs for. He lacks Bill Clinton's raw political skill, and he also lacks Clinton’s biography. In 1992, the Clinton team could re-introduce the Arkansas governor as the son of a single mom from modest roots. Romney appears scared of patches of his biography. His wife seems great, but so did Elizabeth Dole and Tipper Gore, who were also called on to bedazzle voters into overcoming their doubts about their husbands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney has another hurdle: He can’t take advantage of the ideological flexibility that allows primary candidates to refashion themselves as general election candidates because he has already shifted on everything from abortion to his status as a Republican to his advocacy for gay rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All candidates try to shed the pointed views they held during the primaries or at least downplay them. In 2008, Obama's top economic adviser Austan Goolsbee quietly told a Canadian official that his boss was merely posturing when he promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, that it was just talk to rile up the base and he didn't really mean it. The Obama team had to insist he'd never do such a thing. Of course, as Goolsbee predicted, Obama never followed through on his primary campaign rhetoric. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney can’t do this. The press and the Democrats have him so pinned down, an aide can't say “Etch A Sketch” without having it become the new symbol for Romney's lack of core convictions. When Ann Romney said she was going to \"unzip the real Romney,\" and introduce him to Americans, it threatened to animate this storyline again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president called out Romney by name Tuesday in his critique of Paul Ryan’s budget, a continuation of Joe Biden’s effort the week before to tie the front-runner to the Republican Congress. As Ezra Klein points out, Romney has tried to stay vague on the details of his proposals, and Obama is trying to staple Romney to the highly detailed plan that he has endorsed. If, as the nominee, Romney tries to suggest he might do something different from Ryan while still supporting it—as he did last year with the congressman’s aggressive plan for restructuring Medicare—the Obama campaign will pounce. What normally might be seen as a garden-variety political act of “flexibility” might quickly be seen as another example of Romney’s lack of core convictions. ||||| Absent a political earthquake, the GOP nomination outcome is set in stone. Willard Mitt Romney will be the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. And just as the red hot Republican Revolution of 1994 was followed by Bob Dole's ascension in 1996, the Tea Party Uprising of 2010 is being followed by the nomination of Obamacare's ideological architect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, the fat lady has sung. As conservative talker Hugh Hewitt declared on National Review Online last night, \"The race for the GOP nomination is still over.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, writing for NRO's \"The Corner\" said this: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Santorum has earned another run in 2016 or 2020. But it is three long weeks until the next set of primaries. He is guaranteed to lose four of five contests on that day, and he may even lose the delegate battle in Pennsylvania — a potentially crippling embarrassment for his future plans. Santorum has no real chance to stop Romney and may squander the admiration he has won in the GOP base. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Too bad Mitt Romney's opponents are walking around like Bruce Willis in \"The Sixth Sense.\" As former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford noted in a column for Fox News, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are not swayed by political logic or delegate math. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Mathematical certainties at this point mean nothing to Gingrich and have never meant anything to Santorum. If they did, Santorum would never have entered the race in the first place.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for Gingrich, the statement he released after last night's losses suggest the former speaker is planning to continue his fight all the way though Tampa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our party must commit itself to a bold, conservative platform.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Obama: Budget a ‘Trojan horse’ Romney hits Obama on jobs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s a new season, one in which the president attacks his likely GOP opponent by name in TV ads and on the stump and the all-but-certain Republican nominee blithely ignores his intraparty rivals so as not to distract from his mocking rhetoric about Obama. The calendar may say April, but with Obama tweaking Romney as a stuffy rich guy for saying “marvelous” and Romney hammering Obama as a detached megalomaniac “surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers,” the rhetoric has reached October-like levels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That doesn’t mean Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich will quit. But such an intense and personal back-and-forth between the two eventual opponents relegates the others to the sidelines. And Romney’s methodical string of primary victories puts his rivals firmly in his rear-view mirror at last. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: PHOTOS: 50 craziest quotes of the 2012 race) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By opening fire on Romney, Obama is doing his part to bring the primary to a close. The White House and Chicago have clearly calculated that they must start defining Romney now for a broader audience — even if that means hastening the end of a hard-edged nomination fight that has sent the former Massachusetts governor’s favorable numbers plummeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama’s blistering speech Tuesday linking Romney and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and portraying Republicans as “social Darwinists” will only heighten the desire of GOP officials to get on with the business of the general election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The attacks that Obama is launching on the GOP House, the Ryan budget and Mitt Romney will actually intensify the pressure on Santorum, Gingrich and Paul to end their campaigns and redirect their fire away from the front-runner and toward the president,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a longtime GOP strategist who is unaligned in his party’s primary. “Republicans instinctively know the real fight is now in the general election, not the primaries. The longer candidates who can’t win the nomination remain in the race, the more they run the risk of being blamed for weakening the GOP nominee in the general election. Romney realized that in 2008, ended his campaign, helped the winner and was rewarded in 2012. His competitors would be wise to emulate his example.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even as they dropped Wisconsin, Washington, D.C., and Maryland to Romney on Tuesday, none of the three other GOP hopefuls appears to be in any mood to withdraw from the race. Yet there are also signs that they’re readying the ground for an eventual exit. Gingrich, his campaign scaled down, is musing about how he can affect the platform. And Santorum is now essentially giving himself an escape hatch from the race by elevating the state he represented in Congress into a do-or-die showdown. “We have to win Pennsylvania,” the former senator said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about the April 24 primary. ||||| The GOP primary has been over de facto for a number of weeks now. Despite many victories in the South and close races in the Midwest, Rick Santorum has not shown an ability to appeal to suburban Republicans and those not in the party base in virtually any race. Wisconsin’s loss confirms not only that the Santorum coalition is a minority of the GOP, but close examination shows that he is losing his grip on his own voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exit poll shows Santorum ran even among very conservative voters. To win the nomination, he needs to win those voters by wide margins. He also continued to lose somewhat conservative voters, the largest single ideological segment of the primary electorate, by over 20 points. Once again he was demolished in the suburbs, losing all Milwaukee suburban counties by 15-30 points. But even worse, his margins in the rural counties were smaller than they were in Illinois just a couple of weeks ago. Perhaps that’s because he won white evangelicals by only four points, his smallest margin to date. Slowly, some part of the Santorum coalition is moving toward Romney, presumably to end the primary race and begin the general election in earnest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only reason Wisconsin is so close is that Santorum benefited from last-minute decisions by liberal Democrats to vote in the GOP primary, something the Badger State (which does not have partisan registration) permits. Santorum heavily carried the 11 percent of the electorate who said they were Democrats, the 12 percent who said they strongly oppose the Tea Party, and the 14 percent who strongly disapprove of Governor Scott Walker. Needless to say, there are not many states where liberal Democratic votes can deliver a Republican primary win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Santorum has run a noble race and gained a lot of credit for himself and his views. He probably shouldn’t drop out now — his home state votes on April 24 and shortly thereafter some more conservative states cast their ballots. But for all practical intents, his chance at the nomination has gone to meet its maker and joined the choir invisible. His is an ex-campaign.

It used to be the suspense was over who would win. Now, given that we all know who will win — The King’s Speech, Colin Firth, Natalie Portman, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo — the suspense is over which of them won’t win. Not Colin Firth. I mean Colin Firth will not NOT win. As I said on CBS Sunday Morning today, he’s not a lock, he’s a locked locked in a locked lock. And he deserves the prize, although mostly for his work in last year’s A Single Man. In Firth’s case, the suspense is over what the hell he can say that he hasn’t said to the NY and LA critics, to BAFTA, to SAG NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You'll find my predictions for the awards below the blog; you'll see how right I was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:50 Sorry for sounding sexist about Anne and Mila Kunis's boobs but there was very little tonight to engage the eye and ear. I'll be on CNN too early in the a.m. tomorrow with Jessica Coen of Jezebel. I'll try not to sound like Rex Reed some snide bitchy jerk... but it will be hard. Thank you so much for sticking around and sharing the pain. See Winter's Bone!!!!!!!!!!!! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:44 Next year's co-hosts... Charlie Sheen and Mel Gibson? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:43 Anne Hathaway wins for biggest fake eyelashes... Those kids sound so much better than Gwyneth did... Unfair, Edelstein, cheap shot... I know... But I always dreamed, even when I was a kid before the Internet, that I'd one day LIVE BLOG THE OSCARS and now I have and there has just been so little to say that hasn't been said. What I think has happened is that here at Vulture and elsewhere we've written so much about the Academy Awards that we really have made the actual thing seem as if it happned long ago in a galaxy far, far away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:38 Some time I'd like to meet the person who thought it would be interesting to run the king's speech (from the movie) under a montage of clips of the nominated films. It was just another weird disconnect in a night of many. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:35 Some of you in the comments section like that Franco has been so laid-back, so stoner-esque. There are stoned people who can be quite amusing, others who just kind of sit back and think their own amusing thoughts. The latter kind shouldn't maybe host awards shows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:31 I wondered how Colin Firth could make it fresh and he did: He talked as if he'd never won an award for this part, as if he were channeling George VI and his painful stammer. It was nice that he thanked Tom Ford, who helped him break through to something extraordinary in A Single Man--and which he carried over into The King's Speech (and possibly this speech). The only thing is that he didn't seem as if he wanted to dance. I wish he had. Long, dull night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:23 I like seeing David \"Quentin Collins\" Selby on the Oscars in the clip from The Social Network. Tim Burton, take note.He still looks great. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:22 Sandra Bullock is on a first-name basis with the nominees, too. These aren't intros, these are odes. But she's cute with Jeff Bridges doin' the twang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:18 Natalie Portman seems nice. She thanked her parents for giving her life. Some day I hope my daughters get around to doing that while I'm here. She thanked the people who gave her life behind the camera... a long speech but delivered with charming sincerity and emotion. I judge but do not begrudge. Congratz, Natalie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:15 What's with Bridges' creepy first-name addresses of these poor captive actresses? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:12 Warren's mighty proud of his wife and should be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:11 Annette Bening always looks so beautiful in dresses with the suggestion of a collar. That's the extent of my fashion knowledge... I leave it to the Fug Girls to speculate on why Anne Hathaway needs so many costume changes. At a certain point it looks like a desperate way of holding our attention. I wish amid all the swill tonight they'd found a place for live words from Francis Coppola, Eli Wallach, and Kevin Brownlow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:07 Believe it or not, Armond White (!!!!!!!!!!) and I presented Tom Hooper the audience choice award at last year's East Hamptons Film Festival. Was that his first award on American soil? Anyway, I didn't think he'd win--that he did means The King's Speech is so in there for Best Picture. Which means you can shut off the TV after Best Actress. Anyway, I still think the way he cut back and forth between his two leads on opposite sides of the screen suggested he studied drama at Wimbledon. But I'm happy for him mom. Mothers are having a big night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11:00 Jill Claybugh was so radiant, wasn't she? What actors and actresses grab you that way now, just because their soul shines through? It's hard when women are so terrorized into losing weight that there's no room for anything in their faces but eyes and giant lips. Halle Berry's salute to Lena Horne, moving as it was, was also an uncomfortable reminder that African-Americans on the whiter end of the spectrum get through the door first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:48 The coming obits should include a mention of this show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:46 Ricky Gervais ruined the Golden Globes not by being rude but by going after the low-hanging fruit--by being rude without being witty. What he did resonates here because the producers have gone in the opposite direction, working so hard not to offend anyone that they haven't managed to engage anyone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:39 65cyclista below has written that Franco's performance tonight makes her (or him?) want to cut her/his arm off. He hasn't bothered me that much. But he's not there. She's singing and dancing and mugging and acting her heart out and he's not projecting anything. He brings so little to the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:33 There was a certain comfort level when Billy Crystal hosted that hasn't been equaled since. It was like Carson back in the day and Bob Hope before him. But I'm not sure bringing Hope in like that played much better than Nancy Marchand did in her posthumous edited-together-from-outtakes final episode on The Sopranos. The producers' desire to look back does not speak well for their confidence in their own abilities, even if the older members will be pleased that this isn't only about wooing the younger demographic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:25 Charles Ferguson: \"Not a single financial executive has gone to jail, and that's wrong.\" Yes, Inside Job does leave you thinking, \"String 'em up!\" I wrote that I could barely watch it through gritted teeth and marveled that Ferguson could hold to a tone of objectivity. Looks like he couldn't keep up the equanimity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:20 Would you also want to breathe Oprah's air? Send e-mails to nytimes.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:18 The short film God of Love was a little slick for my taste, but everyone will look at this tall curly haired dude talking like an Aaron Sorkin character and want to work with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:13 \"He made out with my co-host... in a movie.\" Come on, writers, try. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10:11 I wish our president had sung a few bars. I wish Kevin Spacey hadn't. I'd be more pleased with Spacey if he didn't always look so pleased with himself. Randy Newman has written some of my favorite double-edged songs, like \"Sail Away,\" and I'm quite partial to \"That'll Do, Pig\" (in spite of how often I hear it at the dinner table). But he has become what he once parodied. Meanwhile, there were better songs in Tangled (all of them). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:57 Nikki Finke thinks they shouldn't have let Kirk Douglas present. I... like that Douglas had fun. I, like many of you, can't write what I truly think. But I hope I'll never have cause to relate to how hard people try to hold onto certain physical and physiognomic (if that's a word) attributes beyond reason... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:48 Of course, Inception won for sound. It was quite an aural tapestry. The best work in this category, for The Fighter, wasn't nominated. But nice of the winners to mention their union. I wonder if anyone will express solidarity with the Wisconsin union workers tonight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:45 That fine, noncommittal, Eno-airport score for The Social Network has deservedly won... but what I'm thinking about is that not all men are comfortable hugging. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:40 For those of you who aren't watching, Bale and Leo have won. Anne with an \"e\" sang \"On My Own\" very well with \"funny\" lyrics about Hugh Jackman letting her down. Everyone's picking on old Hugh tonight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:35 Thank you so much, Christian, mate, for reminding us what a Brit you are because once your career took off you couldn't talk like that ever... And, mate, I just love your forgetting your wife's name... no, you were choked up... that's lovely. Americans never say stuff like \"You are my mast through the storm of life.\" If we did, we'd get laid a lot more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:29 Helen Mirren and Russell Brand are an inspired combination. They should host together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:26 Anne is like a big, gorgeous marionette in her musical lover number [FREUDIAN SLIP-9:29]. She is great. And do you see how comfortable mugging she is? It works against her onscreen, but she'd do well in musicals. [As I typed the above... FIRST CHARLIE SHEEN JOKE!] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:21 Good on old David Seidler. He became obsessed with the story of George VI because he stuttered as a child. Which is another lesson that disabilities can be turned into Oscars, either behind the scenes or in front of the camera. And given the slashing of government programs for the disabled as taxes aren't raised and revenues fall, Hollywood might have to step in and subsidize all those people on whom it relies for awards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:17 Sorkin speaks with the same unnaturally fluidity with which he writes. Makes it easier to talk over rude piano and strings... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:08 How quickly Anne and James became bystanders. What was all that rehearsing about?... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:06 Ha! The Lost Thing. Y'know I picked this one and no one else did. Very sweet and poignant... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:04 Memo to Justin Timberlake: Make Mila Kunis laugh as much as possible so she showily (and show-stoppingly) bends over... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:02 Oh, Melissa Leo, she really looks surprised. I love her. I even love her swearing. Okay, I don't totally love her dithering. And she should have been better prepared, she was the favorite. But... I hear stories about actors... and I've never heard anything but love sonnets about her... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:53 On his deathbed, Kirk's last words will be trying to get some tootsie to climb in with him... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:46 A lot of folks have bashed Alice in Wonderland, including in Vulture's critical worst-of-the-year round-ups. They're full of it. It looked terrific. Like most of Tim Burton's films, it plays wittily with perspective... more wittily than the art director putting the Mad Hatter hat on the Oscar, which didn't get a close-up... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:41 Lame material is better done by people you want to sleep with, though... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:40 \"Anne, honey, stand up straight...\" That was old when Shirley Temple did it... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:38 A different dress than she wore on the red carpet to come into the theater? That seems wasteful... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:36 What's great about this opening montage is that they just get access to EVERYTHING. They're the friggin' Oscars. It's not that it's good material, it's second-rate, it's just that such silliness performed by such Hollywood royalty... is enjoyably silly.... Ann Hathaway gives off this vibe that says, \"I'm so game.\"... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Totally unsatisfying mash-up montage of Best Picture nominees. Did Darren Aronofsky direct it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:29 Lotta people on the red carpet saying they loved The Social Network. The King's Speech not so much. Upset? No, the King's Speech lovers are not on the damn red carpet.... they're taking the disabled ramp in their wheelchairs... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8:25 Roberto Benigni voted THE BEST ACCEPTANCE SPEECH EVER? By an organ grinder's monkey, maybe. I might be sick. I'm having concentration camp flashbacks. Ugh.... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MY PREDICTIONS: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before we begin with the live blogging, some opening thoughts. Natalie Portman is allegedly a very nice person — and I can’t get used to the idea of rooting against any artist. But Annette Bening, come on. She gave the more daring performance last year in Mother and Child, but right now she’s my favorite actress, mostly because she’s so brilliant at locating the actress inside the characters she plays, the ones presenting an image to the world and, often, failing. Her character in The Kids Are All Right is among her most subtle portraits — though still hilarious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman, her forehead liberated, gave the performance of her life in the neglected Rabbit Hole. Michelle Williams surpassed herself (and Ryan Gosling) in Blue Valentine. Jennifer Lawrence broke your heart in Winter’s Bone as a girl trying so hard not to emote. When Portman wins tonight, it will be because she lost all that weight and suffered mightily. She’ll win because actors win awards when you see the acting, even though some of the greatest acting looks effortless. That’s why The Fighter's Bale (weight loss, accent) and Leo (accent, scenery-chewing) will win, too. I love both those performances, but I’d be thrilled to pieces if John Hawkes or Jeremy Renner surprised everyone. And Amy Adams and her cute little tum, a win for her would make me happy, too. (When you watch the clips of Bening and Kidman, you’ll be amazed all over again that neither Julianne Moore nor Aaron Eckhart were nominated.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the way, a big cheer for Hawkes and Dale Dickey, who won Indie Spirit awards for Winter’s Bone. Too bad about that tour-de-force of idiocy Black Swan getting the others. But when an indie auteur like Darren Aronofsky breaks this big, it has to turn a lot of heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking of auteurs, I agree with those who think there might be a picture-director split this year. Fincher is the rare commercial filmmaker who’s also beloved of auteurists (well, some) and the pudgy fanboys (boxers in their dreams) who bonded with him over Fight Club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other predictions: Sorkin (a no brainer — that movie is so WRITTEN), David Seidler for being in his seventies and waiting for the Queen Mother to croak before finishing The King’s Speech. I haven’t seen all the foreign films, but I’d be surprised if too many people cast votes for a movie as punishing (and unenlightening) as Biutiful, even if they all had to watch it for Bardem’s (great) performance. Suzanne Bier’s picture has the buzz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About the docs I don’t know what to think. Inside Job is the obvious choice but Banksy could sneak in, as he has snuck in so many places. As Alex Gibney and I discussed over at bloggingheads on Friday, if a doc as cheeky and unconventional as Exit Through the Gift Shop got past the unbelievably conservative Academy doc nominating committee, it could go all the way. (The Los Angeles Times’s recent fact-checking of the film — disproving suspicions, which I shared, that Mr. Brainwash was a Banksy creation — might seal the deal.) I’ll be happy if either wins —they’re both on my 10 Best List. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, despite my undying love for Winter’s Bone and Toy Story 3 and The Fighter, they and The Social Network will genuflect before The King’s Speech — which will win because, according to my pal Lynda Obst, Harvey’s been playing on the sentiments of the againg, anti-Internet crowd; and because as much as we’re all affected by that shameless, royalist crowd-pleaser, show biz types relate more than anyone to the existential terror of standing before a crowd and not being able to get the words out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, congratulations to the Sex and the City 2 gals and the Shyamster for pulling out big wins at the Razzies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All right, then.

He then teased nominees by taking detours -- \"you know,\" he kept repeating -- that kept him from revealing the winner.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have learned that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is deeply divided over whether to bring back Ricky Gervais to three-peat as host of the Golden Globe Award but, with the Globes less than two months away, the organization has to decide one way or the other by Thursday or Friday at the latest. The HFPA membership appears roughly evenly split on inviting Rude Ricky back for his third hosting stint, but both sides are united in their anger at NBC for its seeming lobbying to have the comedian back and pressuring the HFPA to follow suit. Says a source close to the discussion: “NBC has put the HFPA in a lose-lose situation. If the Hollywood Foreign Press says ‘Yes’ to Ricky, it risks turning the Globes into ‘The Ricky Gervais Show’ and leaving the impression that they’re annually throwing a great party while inviting someone who humiliates all of the guests. If it says ‘No,’ the HFPA looks like it has no sense of humor about itself. The problem is, if you have Ricky, the show tends to wind up being all about him and how mean he can be. He effectively dwarfs the importance of the ceremony itself.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other argument being waged by membership is that there has been more and more consistent chatter about … Read More » ||||| Michael Caulfield/WireImage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hollywood's Super Bowl was supposed be a match-up between Colin Firth and The King's Speech versus the nerds billionaire boys of The Social Network, with some gimmes involving Christian Bale thrown in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that's so not what everybody is gonna be talking about now: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: Best quotes from the Oscars red carpet NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Oscars Ever? This was sizing up to be everything the Oscars are not supposed to be: clunky, amateurish, and pretty much lacking in actual entertainment value for those of us not picking up awards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Moment of the Pre-Show: Sitting through the ABC countdown chatfest, which featured the biggest stars in the world and still managed to be really boring. Stop that! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Moment of the Opening: The two montages opening the show were one too many, but as we are fans of (a) Inception; (b) host-inserted award show videos; and (c) Alec Baldwin and Morgan Freeman; we will give this part a pass, mainly because we have a sick feeling that the whole thing about to go downhill from here... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Moment of the Opening: Realizing that James Franco and Anne Hathaway actually were going to keep hosting through the whole thing and it wasn't all an Inception dream. Blame Hugh Jackman for making us think all good actors must be good hosts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Segue: One minute Hathaway is yelling something about lesbians and then... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HOT PICS! All the Oscar arrivals photos NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Biggest WTF: And then Tom Hanks comes talking about Gone With the Wind...which already won, we're fairly sure. Like 60 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Save: Kirk Douglas isn't the obvious choice for a show aiming at a younger demographic, but the screen idol proved that his charm is undiminished, though the show did seem to get sidetracked by his antics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Takeaway, Part One: For all the talk about Melissa Leo turning off voters with her personal For Your Consideration ad, she not only won, but she probably ensured that next year we'll see more of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Takeaway, Part Two: Oh, and that they'll keep using the dump button to bleep out inadvertent cursing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Written Speeches: A tie. Social Network's Aaron Sorkin and King's Speech scribe David Seidler offered up wry, well-written speeches, which just got us wishing they'd been around to help out with this telecast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Commercial: Christian Bale dropping in a plug for the website of Dickie Eklund during a speech that ended on a moving note as he talked about his wife and daughter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst Commercial: ABC letting us know that they were going to be airing the show for the next ten years, which didn't make us feel comforted at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Quip: \"That's gross,\" said the divine Cate Blanchett, while presenting the make-up award to The Wolfman. We already love her, but she wins geek points for knowing the sci-fi term for \"Excellent work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Star-Making Performance: Luke Matheny's vibrant, funny speech for Live Action Short Film was not only a jolt of energy for the show, but it made us want to watch whatever he does next. And really if you're going to be charming, it's probably not a bad idea to do it in a roomful of film executives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Latest Entrance: Billy Crystal showed up and got a standing ovation, both for his past hosting work and in hopes he might stay and host the rest of this one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Biggest Disconnect: Maybe we missed the memo, but for a show that was supposed to draw in the youth, it seemed to rely on old(er) folks for its best bits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best (Delayed) Comeback: Robert Downey Jr. may have seemed a little prickly at the Golden Globes when Ricky Gervais made a stale joke about his past mishaps, but he and Jude Law managed to mine his past for a funny bit on stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Second Best (Delayed) Comeback: Christian Bale's sly allusion to his own infamous f-bomb barrage while mentioning costar Leo's bleep-worthy moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Musical Performance: As much as Florence Welch and Gwyneth Paltrow were terrific, Randy Newman not only got a deserved Best Song win but he gave a drily comic speech that killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Mom: Tom Hooper won for The King's Speech, and then told how his mother basically found The King's Speech for him. Isn't that like a mom: First, she finds where you left your bookbag, then she finds you an Oscar-winning script. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worst in Translation: In one of the night's best moments, Russell Brand delivered a delightfully incorrect translation of what Helen Mirren was saying while introducing the Best Foreign Language Film award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best Host: Sandra Bullock delivered the goods while introducing the Best Actor nominees, making the whole thing seem fun and funny and unpretentious.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 21.34 Excerpts from the Cameron and Sarkozy letter: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is clear to us the (Libyan) regime has lost any legitimacy that it could have. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To end the suffering of the Libyan people, Muammar Gaddafi and his clique must leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to send a clear political signal that we consider the Council as a viable political counter-party and an important voice for the Libyan people at this time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 20.51 In a symbol of unity, Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy have sent a letter to EU President Herman Van Rompuy stating “Gaddafi and his clique should leave”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 20.29 William Hague speaking to Channel 4: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Certainly the Gaddafi regime is trying to strike back and listening to his son in the interview that he gave earlier today he sounds like he is declaring war against his own people, so I think it does all add to the grave concerns that we have about the situation...there is a lot more urgent work to do over the next few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If they now set out on the bombardment of civilians in many towns and cities and the world could see what was happening then certainly we would be saying there should be a no fly zone. We've done the preparatory work on that with France at the UN security council but it has to be clear that that's legal, that there's a demonstrated need for it and that there is support for it in the Arab world as well.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For over a week, outgunned civilian irregulars, later supported by defecting army units, had defiantly held the coastal town of Ras Lanuf against a vastly better-equipped enemy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the ever-intensifying onslaught against them reached a violent crescendo as the Libyan leader stepped up his efforts to force the rebels back towards the revolution's main stronghold in the eastern city of Benghazi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 19.07 Incredible images from New York Times photographer Tyler Hicks.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about a Libyan state television report that forces loyal to Gaddafi had cleared Ras Lanuf of \"armed gangs\", Hafiz Ghoga, spokesman for the rebel National Libyan Council, said: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, this is not accurate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All we are seeing there is bombardment with heavy artillery from the sea and the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Libyan people are facing genocide, the annihilation of an entire population through the use of air power and heavy artillery. This does not just threaten the security of Libya but that of the whole region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.N. is capable of taking the necessary steps to stop such carnage. We demand a bombardment of the camps where he (Gaddafi) keeps his mercenaries and the roads he uses to transport them and his security forces.

A Nigerian migrant worker called Silverter told Reuters: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the rebels are in control. They are strong and have a lot of ammunition. All they want is to see Gaddafi leave. They do not care how many of them die, they want him out. I saw buildings bombed and people die in front of my eyes. They just dropped dead. Man, the situation was crazy and I said, 'why stay here?'

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following these rating actions, we suspended our ratings on Libya due to the imposition of sanctions and because of a lack of reliable economic and political information. Sanctions effectively preclude us from maintaining a sovereign rating on Libya and because we currently lack timely and reliable information to maintain surveillance on the ratings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 17:19 Clarification on Nato's plans, from US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates: apparently the organisation will not be increasing the number of ships in the Mediterranean, but will be moving the ships it has in that sea closer to Libya's coast: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's my impression that we're really not talking so much about increasing the number of ships, as it is about repositioning ships that are already in the region (closer to Libya).

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 17:11 Rebel forces have denied Libyan state TV's claims that Ras Lanuf has fallen, according to Reuters, but they say that government forces are hitting it hard with tanks and air strikes, and have reached well into the coastal town.

We believe that Gaddafi is in this for the long haul. He appears to be hunkering down for the duration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:57 State TV has claimed that Gaddafi's forces have \"purged\" Ras Lanuf and are now moving towards Benghazi, the rebel's main stronghold: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The town of Ras Lanuf has been purged of armed gangs and the green flags have been hoisted over all (government) buildings. Libyan armed forces are advancing on Benghazi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:48 A fuller quote from Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato Secretary General: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need a clear legal basis and I assume that will be a clear UN mandate. The current UN Nations Security Council resolution 1970 doesn't authorise the use of armed forces. Having said that, I can't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Colonel Gaddafi continues attacking his people systematically. But I have to say we do not look for intervention in Libya and we will need a clear legal basis for any action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:43 Hillary Clinton has warned against taking unilateral action in Libya: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Absent international authorization, the United States acting alone would be stepping into a situation whose consequences are unforeseeable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She adds that the United States is concerned over Gaddafi's remaining chemical weapons as well as \"other nasty stuff\" he might have in his arsenal.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:27 More from the Nato Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who says that there is a risk that Libya could become a divided, failed state: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is... the risk of division within the country and the risk of seeing a failed state in the future that could be breeding ground of extremism and terrorism, so obviously this is a matter of concern. We strongly urge the government of Libya to stop violence and allow a peaceful transition to democracy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:25 Loyalist forces have launched a new major offensive in the oil town of Ras Lanuf, according to Al Jazeera English.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Al Jazeera) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:06 More on the possibility of the imposition of the no-fly zone; Mr Rasmussen says that as well as a clear UN mandate, it would need to be shown that there is a clear need and firm support from other nations in the region. An ITV journalist wonders if such a condition-laden response is sending a rather weak message to Col Gaddafi, but Mr Rasmussen says that Nato will not stand idly by while Gaddafi \"systematically\" attacks his people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16:02 Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen is giving a live news conference for the organisation in Libya. He says a no-fly zone is a possibility, but would require a clear mandate from the UN and further planning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We want to see the international community support it,\" she told Sky News when asked about a no-fly zone over Libya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it's very important that this not be a U.S.-led effort because this comes from the people of Libya themselves. This doesn't come from the outside, this doesn't come from some Western power or some Gulf country saying 'This is what you should do',\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi are trying to suppress a revolt against his 41-year rule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton said the crisis could be protracted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've called for Colonel Gaddafi to leave. We believe that he has totally given up any legitimacy to power. When a leader turns against his own people, that is the end. But we know that there is a long road ahead for being able to try to resolve this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We'd like to see this resolved peacefully. We would like to see him (Gaddafi) go peacefully. We would like to see a new government come peacefully,\" Clinton said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But if that's not possible, then we are going to work with the international community. Now there are countries that do not agree with that and we think it's important that the United Nations make this decision, not the United States. So far the United Nations has not done that,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the possibility of lifting a recently imposed arms embargo on Libya and supporting the rebels, Clinton said: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everything is being looked at. It is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that's going on now to even know how you would do that, because right now it's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britain and France are working on a U.N. Security Council resolution establishing a no-fly zone over Libya which they could put forward if they believed conditions warranted it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Western allies still appear divided over the wisdom of a no-fly zone and how it would be implemented, and there are doubts over whether China and Russia would support a Security Council resolution authorizing such a zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pressed on whether the United States would support a no-fly zone, Clinton said: \"We are going to support the efforts that are being made because we think that the people of Libya themselves have to be supported and we know how difficult this struggle is.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed in a telephone call on Tuesday to press forward with planning on a range of possible responses to the Libyan crisis, including a no-fly zone, the White House said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague said earlier on Tuesday that a no-fly zone would have to have \"a clear legal basis, a demonstrable need and strong international support.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Reporting by Olesya Dmitracova and Adrian Croft; editing by Janet Lawrence) ||||| A joint British and US statement said a plan for a no-fly zone, as requested by many of the rebels, was among the ideas being discussed. Action would also include surveillance and enforcement of the arms embargo against Libya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men spoke as residents of the town of Zawiyah to the west of Tripoli took to the rooftops with loudhailers to appeal to their fellow-citizens not to give up the fight as scores of tanks streamed into the central square. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fragmented reports from the town, where telephones, electricity and the internet have all been cut, said shells were hitting residential buildings and mosques and bodies were lying in the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Television footage of the two-week-long battle for control of the town showed dead bodies of soldiers lying in the streets and casualties pouring into the hospitals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the east of the country, rebel forces managed to maintain control of the town of Ras Lanuf, also seat of an oil terminal, despite aerial bombardment that included at least five air strikes, including on a block of flats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But attempts to break out to the west were met with devastating government firepower, leading to a rebel decision to reinforce its volunteer troops with units of the regular army that have defected to their side but not yet been employed against their former comrades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama and his administration have been markedly more reluctant to support a no-fly zone than Mr Cameron and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. But he has also come under pressure to act as Col Gaddafi’s military fightback has intensified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The significance of control over Libya’s oil facilities was emphasised when William Hague, the foreign secretary, told MPs he was considering whether to push for international action to take billions of dollars of Libyan oil revenues away from the Gaddafi regime and put them under United Nations control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plan, inspired by the oil-for-food system imposed on Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, would require a decision by the United Nations Security Council, which is already under pressure to impose a no-fly zone over Libya in light of Col Gaddafi’s use of air power to try to crush the rebellion against his 41-year-rule. ||||| A no-fly zone over Libya would likely have a limited impact on Moammar Gadhafi's offensives against rebel forces and civilians, military experts said Tuesday, as pressure appeared to be intensifying for restrictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Launching its annual report on international military might, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said the use of jets by Gadhafi loyalists appeared to pose less of a threat than the deployment of attack helicopters _ which can get around flight prohibitions because they are harder to detect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also warned that defense budget cuts in the West over the last year had accelerated a shift in military powers toward emerging countries in Asia and the Middle East. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Tuesday that contingency work is being carried out by Britain and France on a potential United Nations Security Council resolution that would sanction a no-fly zone over Libya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be a demonstrable need that is accepted broadly by the international community, as well as the strong international support that would come from that,\" Hague said following talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abbas said the Arab League would discuss the prospects of a no-fly zone being imposed at talks this weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Douglas Barrie, military aerospace analyst at the institute, said Gadhafi has around 300 combat aircraft, but that far fewer are likely to be operational and that the leader appeared increasingly reliant on around 35 attack helicopters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because they are far smaller and slower moving than jets, it means traditional methods used to enforce a no-fly zone could fail to catch them, he said. Some radar can struggle to distinguish between a helicopter and a fast-moving car or truck, for instance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has suggested a no-fly zone would require an attack on Libya's air defenses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barrie said that would not necessarily be required, and that Gadhafi's regime was poorly equipped in any case. \"It's not a risk free proposition, but the Soviet-era kit that the Libyans are equipped with is not state of the art,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States and NATO allies on Monday increased the number of surveillance flights over Libya, while Britain and France said they had also begun drafting a U.N. resolution that could establish a no-fly zone.

{"context": "America's Most Dangerous Cities For Women NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We analyzed crime data for U.S. cities to find the most dangerous metro areas for women. The following 10 cities have the highest violent crime rates and incidences of forcible rape in the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| Twenty-seven-year-old Army specialist Casey Bogenrief was set to deploy from Fort Wainright in Fairbanks, Alaska, in a few days when he met a young woman who invited him to her apartment to have a drink and sing karaoke. Shortly after arriving, the soldier is said to have become violent and demanded to have sex with the woman before slamming her head against a door and assaulting her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While his attorney says that any sexual contact was consensual, Bogenrief stands trial this week for rape, putting him among the hundreds of annual perpetrators of the crime in the city that’s been called a hotbed for sexual violence. For a metro area that the FBI measures at just 38,307, an incredibly high rate of rape (more than double the national metropolitan average) lands Fairbanks among the top three most dangerous cities for women in the United States at 193 reported rapes per 100,000 residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To calculate cities where women are at risk for becoming victims of both violent crimes and sexual assault, we analyzed data from the FBI Uniform Crime Report, which tallies crime data for each of the country’s metropolitan statistical areas, regions that usually consist of a large city and its suburbs or clusters of closely linked smaller cities, and metropolitan divisions, which are core areas within some of the larger MSAs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We used the FBI’s numbers for violent crimes including murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault in addition to reported incidences of rape in each metro area. While the FBI warns that reporting can be troubling for ranking purposes (particularly as they only measure cases of “forcible rape” which discounts date-rape, statutory rape and other sexual assaults), and RAINN stresses that reported cases of rape barely scratch the surface of the true magnitude of the crime, the numbers are clear in one thing: for women in Alaska and Michigan, the threat of sexual assault is clear and present. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only four months into the calendar year there have been 274 rapes in Detroit, Mich., in 2012 including four cases of serial rapists in the city. But surprisingly, the smaller city of Saginaw, some 90 miles from the auto manufacturing capitol suffers even higher incidences of the crime at 76 rapes for every 100,000 people in the metro area that the FBI measures at 197,310. Added to a troublingly high rate of nonsexual violent crimes (870 per 100,000), that number makes Saginaw, Mich., the country’s most dangerous city for women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Pictures: The 10 Most Dangerous Cities For Women NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, according to a 2011 survey, more than 37% of Alaskan women report that they've suffered some form of sexual assault in their lives. And Fairbanks isn’t the only Alaskan city to top our ranking. Anchorage suffers the highest violent crime rate in the state, (812 reported for every 100,000 residents) in addition to a staggeringly high incidence of rape. According to numbers from the FBI Uniform Crime Report, more than 85 rapes are committed annually per 100,000 citizens, which makes Anchorage No. 2 on our list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott Berkowitz, the president of RAINN (the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) says that while data on reported incidences of rape is often unreliable, researchers and advocates have historically seen higher rates of sexual violence in native communities. In Alaska, where nearly 15% of the population is American Indian or Alaskan Indian, Berkowitz says this could be a key factor. Research points to as many as one in three Indian women will be raped or sexually assaulted in her lifetime--a rate 3.5 times higher than any other racial groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fourth most dangerous city as ranked by our list is Springfield, Ill., a metro area of 200,000 four hours south of Chicago where the FBI reports 855 violent crimes and 70 rapes each year per 100,000 citizens. Despite its dangerous ranking, the state of llinois has made great strides to respond to violent crimes against women; Illinois currently has more than 33 24-hour rape crisis centers and in 1992 was one of the first states to include rights for victims of violent crime in its state constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Pictures: The 10 Most Dangerous Cities For Women NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At No. 5 on the 2012 list of the most dangerous cities for women is Redding, California, where there were 797 incidences of violent crime and 65 rapes for every 100,000 citizens. For a metro area whose population is just over that number at 182,000, a total of 120 rapes occurred over 12 months. Redding, a Northern California city located in Shasta County, is also becoming proactive about rape prevention. At a recent Sexual Assault Awareness Month event, spokeswoman Jean King of the Shasta women’s Refuge noted that the county suffers twice as many sexual assaults as the rest of the state of California. \"We don't want to have that in our community,” she said before continuing that by making the issue a local one she hopes to see a decline. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flint, Michigan, has also seen rape numbers on the rise, and falls at No. 6 on our list of dangerous cities. Kim Hurst with the Wayne County Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners Program, known as SAFE, told local authorities that her Detroit branch has seen 60 girls in April alone and that her metro numbers are in the hundreds. More foreboding: all the attacks are becoming more violent. \"I have to say we do recently seem to have seen potentially more physical injury with our victims that are coming in,\" she says.

Painted in a remote limestone cavern, they are more than 4000 years older than the previous record holders on nearby Sulawesi, and they add to evidence that thriving artistic traditions were emerging simultaneously in Europe and Asia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until recently, most researchers thought the home of the earliest figurative paintings—those depicting people and animals rather than abstract objects—was France’s Chauvet Cave. Vivid images of prehistoric rhinos, cave lions, and horses there have been dated to about 35,000 years old. But in 2014, a team led by geochemist and archaeologist Maxime Aubert of Griffith University in Gold Coast, Australia, dated paintings of wild pigs in caves on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi to at least 35,400 years old. Stencils of human hands there were at least 40,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, as they report today in Nature , Aubert’s joint Indonesian-Australia team has dated a painting of what may be a banteng, a Southeast Asian wild cattle, in Borneo’s Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, to at least 40,000 years ago; hand stencils there may be up to 52,000 years old, making them among the oldest such prints in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a remarkably important finding,” says Sue O’Connor, an archaeologist at Australian National University in Canberra who focuses on Southeast Asia and Australia, but was not involved in the new study. “It shows that the [previously discovered] Sulawesi rock art … was not regionally unique, but rather is part of a larger artistic and symbolic tradition” tracking some of the earliest modern humans in Southeast Asia, she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rock art adorns many caves in the mountainous province of East Kalimantan. The researchers found that the paintings in Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave are of three styles and ages: the ancient orange animals and hand stencils; purplish hand stencils, intricate motifs, and dynamic human figures dated to 20,000 to 21,000 years ago; and black charcoal designs thought to have been left by Neolithic farmers about 4000 years ago. Over the millennia “there was clearly a shift from depicting the animal world to depicting the human world,” Aubert says—a trend also seen in the cave art of Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To date the paintings, Aubert’s team turned to a now widely used technique, measuring the ratios of uranium and thorium in the calcite crusts that had accumulated on top of the cave paintings. The scientists took 65 different samples and tested for contamination that could have come from sources other than the calcite. They showed that the calcite layers were youngest at the surface and oldest closer to the paintings, meaning the dating is sound, Aubert says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jane Balme, an archaeologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth, says the discovery “draws attention to the widespread similarities in human’s symbolic expression across the globe.” We now know that the famous cave art of Europe “is just one area where such expression occurred 40,000 years ago,” she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But precisely how the various styles of art are linked to waves of migration is still an open question. “The discovery of three different chronological styles is quite amazing, as we can follow the evolution and changes of rock art over 50,000 years,” says Francois-Xavier Ricaut, a biological anthropologist from the University of Toulouse in France, who has also been working on Borneo. He says the big question now is whether the two older types of art represent the arrival of different peoples or were created by one population whose style evolved over time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aubert suspects humans in the region—present as far back as 60,000 to 70,000 years ago—didn’t create art until populations reached a critical mass. That wouldn’t have been true of the region’s earliest inhabitants, of whom no art has been discovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His team plans to look for butchered animal bones, tools, and other traces of the ancient artisans in the caves, starting next year. “We want to find out who made those paintings,” he says."}

The organization has argued that CGI should solely be employed, but others in the industry insist that such technology would be cost-prohibitive. \"It's naïve and untenable and will never happen — we all know that,\" the producer says. \"What's needed is a replacement for the [American Humane Association],\" the non-profit monitoring group financed by producers that's tasked with on-set animal oversight.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to Webb or his remains, but said Friday that the reward will not be paid because Webb's remains were found as part of the investigation. ||||| BOSTON (AP) — For more than two decades, Donald Eugene Webb was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, suspected of fatally shooting the police chief in a small Pennsylvania town in 1980 before vanishing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb has the dubious distinction of having one of the longest tenures on the list. The FBI, still dogged by the killing, recently stepped up publicity around its $100,000 reward to try to focus attention on the long-cold search for Webb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So many years have passed now that the reward is payable not only to anyone who provides information leading to Webb’s arrest but also to anyone who can lead investigators to Webb’s remains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If he is still alive, Webb would be 84. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Webb and Police Chief Gregory Adams crossed paths, Webb was a 49-year-old career criminal with mob ties who specialized in jewelry store robberies along the East Coast. He lived in New Bedford, but investigators believe he was in Saxonburg to case a jewelry store. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adams had moved from Washington, D.C., to escape the violence of a big city and raise his family in Saxonburg, a quiet borough outside Pittsburgh where the most serious crime was usually petty larceny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 4, 1980, Adams pulled Webb over after he ran a stop sign, said Gordon Mainhart, the town’s only other police officer at the time. Webb’s rental car and Adams’ cruiser were seen in the parking lot of an Agway store. A neighbor called 911 after her son heard gunshots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adams had been shot twice in the chest and was found lying in some bushes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It didn’t make any sense,” said Mainhart, who rode in the ambulance with Adams. He died on the way to the hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was devastated — just a feeling of why? And how could this happen?” Mainhart said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb left behind a fake driver’s license that helped authorities figure out his identity. The license was in the name of Stanley Portas, the late husband of Webb’s wife, Lillian. It was an alias Webb had been using. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb’s car was later found abandoned in the parking lot of a Howard Johnson’s restaurant in Warwick, Rhode Island. Authorities found Webb’s blood on the driver’s-side floorboard, confirming suspicion that he’d been wounded during the struggle with Adams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 18 months later, an informant told the FBI he’d seen Webb in Miami. After that, the trail went cold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the years, authorities investigated several theories, including that Webb was killed by members of the Patriarca crime family. Webb was a member of a group of criminals in southeastern Massachusetts known as the Fall River Gang. Authorities believe the gang sold stolen jewelry through the Patriarca family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Key investigators believe Webb is still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The guy is a career criminal. He knows how the system works. There’s a good possibility that he assumed another name and has hidden out there all these years,” said James Poydence, a retired detective with the Pennsylvania State Police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FBI Special Agent Thomas MacDonald said he believes Webb shot Adams because he knew police would learn he was wanted for a burglary in New York and he’d end up back in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb’s wife, who divorced him more than a decade ago, told a reporter she didn’t want to talk about him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adams’ widow, Mary Ann — left with two young sons to raise — remarried and rebuilt her life but still longs to know what happened in the moments before her husband’s death.

But if he’s not dead, I would like to see him prosecuted,” she said. ||||| The search for Donald Eugene Webb, a career criminal with mob ties who allegedly killed a Saxonburg, Pa., police chief in 1980, came to a stunning end Friday when authorities said the fugitive’s remains had been found in his former wife’s backyard in Dartmouth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The remains were dug up Thursday night on the Maplecrest Drive property of 82-year-old Lillian Webb. But investigators learned her former husband died in 1999 while still on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, the bureau said Friday in a statement. He was in his late 60s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Webb had been charged with fatally shooting Chief Gregory Adams in Saxonburg during a traffic stop on Dec. 4, 1980.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She aided and abetted a man that was wanted for murder,” Jones said of Lillian Webb. “Seriously, bury a body in your backyard? It’s still so incredible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attempts to reach Lillian Webb and her lawyer for comment were unsuccessful Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones, whose sons were both under the age of 3 when Adams was killed, said after the announcement that she was at a loss for words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m still trying to process that,” Jones said in a phone interview from Florida. “I have no thoughts on that. It totally flabbergasts me that they buried him in the backyard.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Law enforcement officials did not say Friday how they learned when Donald Webb died. They did not disclose a cause of death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State Police attached to Attorney General Maura Healey’s office had obtained a search warrant for Lillian Webb’s property, as part of a separate investigation, that led to the discovery of her former husband’s body Thursday, according to the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI did not elaborate on the separate probe, but Healey’s office said it had to do with an illegal gambling operation. That probe is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FBI Donald Webb died in 1999 while still on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, the bureau said Friday in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Webb was the only fugitive wanted in the United States for killing a police chief, the FBI said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Although it’s unfortunate Mr. Webb will never be brought to justice to pay for his crimes, we’re hopeful the family can find some closure in knowing that this alleged murderer has been located,” said Harold H. Shaw, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston Division, in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His comments were echoed by Healey, who said in the bureau’s statement that her office “is committed to working with our state police officers, the FBI, Bristol County DA’s Office and Pennsylvania State Police as this investigation continues.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Butler, Pa., District Attorney Richard Goldinger said in an e-mail that he did not expect anyone to be charged criminally in Adams’s death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Lillian Webb was granted immunity,” Goldinger wrote. “Donald Webb was charged in the murder of Chief Adams. Since he is deceased, there is nobody to prosecute for Chief Adams’ murder. We have no other information, at this point, that would lead us to charging any other individuals in this matter.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb went missing soon after the slaying of Adams, who was shot twice at close range in Saxonburg on Dec. 4, 1980, after being “beaten about the head and face with a blunt instrument,” according to the FBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, Webb was living in New Bedford with his wife and stepson and had ties to mobsters in Rhode Island. His white Mercury Cougar was found in a Howard Johnson’s parking lot in Warwick, R.I., about two weeks after the chief’s murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 31, 1980, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Webb alleging unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, after he was charged in Pennsylvania with first-degree murder for Adams’s killing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Webb was a career criminal believed to be in Pennsylvania planning to rob a jewelry store, authorities said. He was wanted at the time for an earlier robbery in New York and allegedly decided to murder Adams rather than go back to prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones said Friday that she wants to know how Donald Webb managed to evade arrest after her husband’s murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s always haunted me,” she said. “How the heck did he get out of Saxonburg?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said the discovery of Webb’s remains have left her pondering a troubling thought about his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Does that family hate my family so much, that they couldn’t give us details that he died, and turn his body over?” Jones said. “Do they have to hide it after he’s dead, so that we still get no justice? I mean, what is wrong with that family?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adams’s murder had a profound effect on the town of Saxonburg as well, according to the current police chief, Joseph Beachem. He said in a phone interview that he spoke with Jones and her sons two years ago at a memorial event for Adams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Talking to other officers in attendance that day, you can’t help looking at them and thinking of your own family and the pain that [Adams’s family has] had to endure,” Beachem said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the statement the FBI released later in the day, the Saxonburg chief said the “biggest question in the history” of the town had been answered with Friday’s announcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our thoughts are with the family and we hope this eases their minds, if even only slightly,” Beachem said.

He studied theatre at Montclair State College, and in 1984 was cast as the lead in Sam Shepard's Fool For Love off-Broadway. He went on to star in the award-winning TV series Moonlighting, which ran from 1985 to 1989. In 1988, he won the part of John McClane in the blockbuster-movie Die Hard, paving the way for a highly successful career as a film actor.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My mother and father taking me to Washington DC. I remember being at the Washington Monument with all the flags around it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which living person do you most admire, and why? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I most admire the young man or woman who is fighting overseas. I don't need to know his or her name, but anybody who has a job that puts them in harm's way and potentially causes them to make the ultimate sacrifice, or to sacrifice any body part, for what they believe is their responsibility to their country, is my biggest hero.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I am trying as hard as I can to remove judgment from my life, especially pre-judgment, which is where the word prejudice comes from.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosanna Greenstreet ||||| What do you get when you mix one part action movie with one part holiday flick and add in a dash of sweaty tank top? Die Hard, John McTiernan’s genre-bending Christmas action masterpiece for the ages, which sees a badass NYPD cop take on a skyscraper full of bad guys in the midst of an office holiday party. Here are 30 things you might not know about the movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. IT’S GOT A LITERARY BACKGROUND. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Think some action-loving Hollywood scribe came up with the concept for Die Hard? Think again. The movie is based on Roderick Thorp’s 1979 crime novel Nothing Lasts Forever, which is a sequel to his 1966 novel, The Detective. In 2013, Thorp’s long out-of-print book was resurrected to coincide with the film’s 25th anniversary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. IT WAS INSPIRED BY THE TOWERING INFERNO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea for Nothing Lasts Forever was inspired John Guillermin’s 1974 disaster flick The Towering Inferno. After seeing the film, Thorp had a dream about a man being chased through a skyscraper by a group of men with guns. He eventually turned that snippet of an idea into a sequel to The Detective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. FRANK SINATRA GOT FIRST DIBS ON PLAYING THE ROLE OF JOHN MCCLANE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because he had starred in the big-screen adaptation of The Detective, Frank Sinatra had to be offered the role in its sequel. At the age of 73, he smartly turned it down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. BRUCE WILLIS’S BIG-SCREEN DEBUT WAS WITH FRANK SINATRA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1980, Willis made his film debut (albeit uncredited) in the crime thriller The First Deadly Sin. He has no name and if you blink you’ll miss him, but the role simply required that Willis entered a diner as Sinatra’s character left it. Maybe it was kismet? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. CLINT EASTWOOD PLANNED TO TAKE A STAB AT THE PART. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Originally, it was Clint Eastwood who owned the movie rights to Nothing Lasts Forever, which he had planned to star in in the early 1980s. That obviously never happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE A SEQUEL TO COMMANDO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is one of the most popular internet stories about Die Hard. But according to Stephen de Souza, the screenwriter of both Die Hard and Commando, while there was a sequel to Commando planned, the only similarity with Die Hard is that they both took place in buildings. According to de Souza, Escape Plan is the closest to his original Commando 2 idea and Die Hard was never supposed to be anything but Die Hard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7. BRUCE WILLIS WASN’T EVEN THE STUDIO’S THIRD CHOICE FOR THE ROLE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Die Hard was to be a success, the studio knew they needed a bona fide action star in the part, so they set about offering it to a seemingly never-ending list of A-listers of the time. Rumor has it that Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, Charles Bronson, Nick Nolte, Mel Gibson, Richard Gere, Don Johnson, Burt Reynolds, and Richard Dean Anderson (yes, MacGyver!) were all considered for the role of John McClane. And all declined it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8. BRUCE WILLIS WAS CONSIDERED A COMEDIC ACTOR AT THE TIME. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Die Hard’s producers had nothing against Bruce Willis, of course. He just wasn’t an immediate choice for the role because, up until that point, he was known solely as a comedic actor, not an action star. Following the success of the film, the action genre really became Willis’s bread and butter, and although he has two Emmys for his comedy work, it has remained as such to this day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9. BRUCE WILLIS WAS BARELY EVEN SEEN ON THE MOVIE’S POSTERS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twentieth Century Fox NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the studio’s marketing gurus were unconvinced that audiences would pay to see an action movie starring the funny guy from Moonlighting, the original batch of posters for the film centered on Nakatomi Plaza instead of Willis’s mug. As the film gained steam, the marketing materials were altered, and Willis was more prominent in the promos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10. WILLIS WAS PAID $5 MILLION TO MAKE THE MOVIE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even with all the uncertainly surrounding whether he could pull the film off, Willis was paid $5 million to make Die Hard, which was considered a rather hefty sum at the time—a figure reserved for only the top tier of Hollywood talents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11. WILLIS SUGGESTED THAT BONNIE BEDELIA PLAY HIS WIFE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though we suspect that she wasn’t paid $5 million for the gig. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 12. BRUCE WILLIS WAS ABLE TO SAY YES THANKS TO A WELL-TIMED PREGNANCY. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first few times Bruce Willis was asked to star in the movie, he had to say no because of his commitments to Moonlighting. Then costar Cybill Shepard announced that she was pregnant. Because her pregnancy wouldn’t work within the show, producer Glenn Caron gave everyone 11 weeks off, allowing Willis to say yes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 13. SAM NEILL WAS ORIGINALLY APPROACHED FOR THE PART OF HANS GRUBER. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Neill ended up turning the film down. Then, in the spring of 1987, the casting director saw Alan Rickman playing the dastardly Valmont in a stage production of Dangerous Liaisons and knew they had found their Hans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 14. DIE HARD WAS ALAN RICKMAN’S FEATURE FILM DEBUT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Rickman may have played the part of Hans as cool as the other side of the pillow, it was actually his first role in a feature film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 15. JOHN MCTIERNAN TURNED THE MOVIE DOWN, TOO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And not just once, but on a few different occasions. His reason was that the material just seemed too dark and cynical for him. “The original screenplay was a grim terrorist movie,” McTiernan told Empire magazine in 2014. “On my second week working on it, I said, 'Guys, there's no part of terrorism that's fun. Robbers are fun bad guys. Let's make this a date movie.’ And they had the courage to do it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 16. MCTIERNAN SEES IT AS A SHAKESPEAREAN TALE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the original script, the action in Die Hard takes place over a three-day span, but McTiernan—inspired by Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream—insisted that it be condensed into a single evening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 17. NAKATOMI PLAZA IS ACTUALLY FOX PLAZA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, the corporate headquarters of 20th Century Fox—the very studio making the movie—proved to be the perfect location for the movie’s much-needed Nakatomi Plaza. And as it was still under construction, there wasn’t a whole lot they needed to do to the space to make it movie-ready. The studio charged itself rent to use its own space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 18. THE ROOM WHERE THE HOSTAGES ARE BEING HELD IS LITERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S FALLINGWATER. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In this period, Japanese corporations were buying America,\" production designer Jackson De Govia said in the Die Hard DVD audio commentary. \"We posited that ... Nakatami Corporation bought Fallingwater, disassembled it, and reassembled it in the atrium, like a trophy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 19. THAT PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE CITY BELOW? IT’S NOT REAL. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 380-foot-long background painting provided the illusion of a breathtaking city view in the movie. And it was a state-of-the-art one, too, with animated lights, moving traffic, and the ability to change from night to day. The painting is still the property of the studio and has been used in other productions since. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 20. THE FILM’S SUCCESS SPAWNED A BONA FIDE FRANCHISE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to its four sequels, Die Hard has spawned video games and comic books, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 21. JOHN MCCLANE’S TUMBLE DOWN A VENTILATION SHAFT WAS AN ACCIDENT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or maybe “error” would be a better word. But in the scene in which McClane jumps into an elevator shaft, his stunt man was supposed to grab onto the first vent. But he missed. By a lot. Which made the footage even more exciting to watch, so editor Frank J. Urioste kept it in the final cut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 22. ALAN RICKMAN’S DEATH SCENE WAS ALSO PRETTY SCARY. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least it was for Rickman. In order to make it look as if he was falling off a building, Rickman was supposed to drop 20 feet onto an air bag while holding onto a stunt man. But in order to get a genuinely terrified reaction out of him, they dropped him on the count of two—not three, as was planned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 23. BRUCE WILLIS SUFFERED PERMANENT HEARING LOSS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twentieth Century Fox NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In order to get the hyper-realism that director John McTiernan was looking for, the blanks used in the guns in the movie were modified to be extra loud. In one scene, Willis shoots a terrorist through a table, which put the action star in extremely close proximity to the gun—and caused permanent hearing loss. He referenced the injury in a 2007 interview with The Guardian. When they asked Willis his most unappealing habit, he replied that, “Due to an accident on the first Die Hard, I suffer two-thirds partial hearing loss in my left ear and have a tendency to say, ‘Whaaa?’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 24. ALAN RICKMAN WASN’T FOND OF THE NOISE EITHER. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whenever he had to shoot a gun in the film, Rickman couldn’t help but flinch. Which forced McTiernan to have to cut away from him so that his reactions were not caught on film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 25. GRUBER’S AMERICAN ACCENT POSED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scene in which Rickman, as Gruber, slips into an American accent and pretends to be yet another hostage who got away was insisted on by screenwriter Steven de Souza, who wanted them in a room together to duke it out. But McTiernan was never happy with Rickman’s American accent, saying, “I still hear Alan Rickman’s English accent. I was never quite happy with the way he opened his mouth [in that scene] ... I shot it three times trying to get him to sound more stridently American ... it’s odd for someone who has such enormous verbal skills; he just had terrible trouble getting an American accent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 26. HANS GRUBER’S GERMAN IS MOSTLY GIBBERISH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the bulk of his German cohorts were not German either. Bruce Willis, on the other hand, was actually born in West Germany to an American father and a German mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 27. BRUCE WILLIS HAS FOUR FEET. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Willis spends much of the movie in his bare feet running through broken glass, he was given a pair of rubber feet to wear as a safety precaution. Which is great and all, but if you look closely in certain scenes, you can actually see the fake appendages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 28. YOU CAN SEE—BUT NOT TOUCH—JOHN MCCLANE’S SWEATY TANK TOP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2007, Willis donated the blood-soaked tank top he wore in Die Hard to the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 29. “YIPPEE-KI-YAY” STOLE THE MOVIE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a simple line: “Yippee-ki-yay, motherf*cker!” But it became the film’s defining moment, and the unofficial catchphrase that has been used in all four Die Hard sequels as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 30. CREDIT FOR THE LINE IS OWED TO WILLIS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a 2013 interview with Ryan Seacrest, Bruce Willis admitted that “Yippee-ki-yay, motherf*cker!” was really just a joke. “It was a throwaway,” said Willis. “I was just trying to crack up the crew and I never thought it was going to be allowed to stay in the film.\" ||||| 'I was at my peak, my physical prime, and then ... ass done. The ass is out!' he laughs to MTV News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our countdown to \"Breaking Dawn - Part,\" Kristen Stewart recently revealed to MTV News that she was so anxious on her first day of filming \"Twilight\" that she almost passed out. \"Almost\" being the key word there, since Stewart recovered in time to film Bella's climactic battle with villainous vamp James. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But how did her co-star and leading man Robert Pattinson fare on his first day? Not much better! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were doing the fight scene at the end of the first one, and I tore my glute — well, almost tore it, basically in my second shot of the whole movie, of the whole series,\" Pattinson recalled. \"[They] had to get a physiotherapist to come in and massage my butt cheek for the rest of the day.

McMillan spent 22 1/2 years behind bars for a rape conviction which was vacated on May 2 because DNA evidence proved he was not guilty of the crime. \"I'm not angry,\" McMillan replied when asked about his wrongful conviction and incarceration. \"I'm really overjoyed.\" EXTRA INFORMATION Investigate what makes up human DNA LEGAL RESOURCES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Latest Legal News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Law Library NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FindLaw Consumer Center Select a topic Bankruptcy Discrimination Divorce Estate Planning Landlord-Tenant Personal Injury Taxes McMillan appeared on television along with Peter Neufeld, a co-founder of the Innocence Project, a group that used DNA technology to clear McMillan. The group is using DNA technology to test hundreds of suspect convictions, most of them made before the technology was widely available. Neufeld blamed McMillan's plight on \"sloppy identification procedures that were utilized by the police, the same kind of procedures that are utilized by the police in Memphis, all over Tennessee, and frankly, all over the United States today.\" During the interview McMillan appeared calm and expressed almost no emotion, and never uttered more than one sentence in answers to questions. McMillan later said the ordeal had left him \"hurt\" because \"it was an unbelievable experience that something like that would happen to me.\" When asked who he blamed, McMillan replied, \"Human error.\" According to the Innocence Project's Web site, McMillan was arrested October 30, 1979, for the rape and robbery with a deadly weapon of a 16-year-old girl. McMillan is African-American. The victim is white. She and her boyfriend had been forced out of their vehicle in Memphis, Tennessee, by a man wielding a knife. Both were forced into nearby woods, forced to disrobe and then lie on the ground. Both were robbed and the girl was raped. Her jeans, containing sperm deposits, were taken into evidence. 119 years Both gave similar descriptions of the attacker but failed to mention a limp, according to the Innocence Project Web site. McMillan had been shot two years earlier, wore a leg brace, and walked with a limp. At trial, the limp was added to the victim's description. The victim and her companion also failed to identify McMillan in a photo array. The girl identified McMillan in a line-up, but her boyfriend chose a different person. Both, however, identified McMillan in a line-up at the trial. McMillan's sister and girlfriend supported his claim that he was with them at the time of the crime, but he was convicted nonetheless and sentenced to 119 years in prison in May 1980. All his appeals were denied. McMillan contacted the Innocence Project in 1996, which spent years tracking down files and evidence. Eventually, semen on the girl's jeans was tested and in April McMillan was ruled out as the rapist. Of the 108 people cleared by the Innocence Project using DNA testing, McMillan has served the longest time in prison. He said the Innocence Project often can't help people like McMillan because evidence is destroyed. Neufeld said the Innocence Project is pushing legislation that would ensure compensation for people who were wrongly convicted and the preservation of evidence. McMillan said he hoped that he could receive some type of compensation, but Neufeld said Tennessee has no compensation statute. At the end of the interview, when asked what he plans to do now, McMillan said, \"I'm just gonna live and take each day at a time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| Clark McMillan (Photo: Submitted) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first person Tennessee paid money to after being wrongly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit says the more than $800,000 awarded to him hasn't been enough.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State lawmakers passed legislation in 2004 to pay McMillan $832,950 to compensate him for his time in prison. His case now points the way forward as a Wilson County man also seeks a formal exoneration and potential compensation for the time he served for a crime he also did not do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McMillan received $250,000 up front with the remainder placed in an annuity that pays him about $3,400 a month, according to the Tennessee Board of Claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But more than two decades in prison rendered McMillan unable to build a career and job skills, he said. An array of medical costs from multiple health issues without adequate insurance also have swallowed much of McMillan’s income, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m treated like I should be glad to have gotten something,” McMillan said. “There has been nothing to cover job training, placement, medical care, post-traumatic stress. Help me restore my dignity so I can get a job. My compensation is controlled by the state and they dictate what my life is worth.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson County’s Lawrence McKinney spent 31 years in prison until his release in 2009 when DNA evidence also proved his innocence in a rape case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKinney has a hearing Tuesday with the Tennessee Board of Parole, which provides a recommendation to the governor on whether to issue a formal exoneration order. The governor is not bound to follow or act on the parole board’s recommendation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKinney's criminal record has been expunged, but if he is exonerated he would be eligible to file for compensation with the Tennessee Board of Claims. Claims are capped at $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is not enough money to compensate people going through something like that,” said Rob Briley, a former state representative and the House sponsor of the legislation for McMillan’s case. Briley is an attorney who also represented McMillan for free before the Tennessee Board of Parole and Tennessee Board of Claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They should increase the compensation and lower the bar to be considered\" for exoneration, he said. \"That is not easy to get from the governor.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state has paid only two exoneration claims, McMillan’s and about $142,000 to a man in 2012 who was exonerated after spending two years and three months in prison after being wrongly convicted of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual battery of a 9-year-old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorney David Raybin, who is part of McKinney's legal team, said he opposes how the state puts money into an annuity for those wrongly convicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You don’t do that in personal injury cases,\" he said. \"They could invest. Let them spend it how they see fit.

McMillan and his wife are diabetic, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Qualifying for subsidized health insurance has been a challenge because of his income with the annuity, McMillan said. He also suspects the stigma of prison, even with his conviction vacated and charges dismissed, also has lingered with employers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They did give me something and a lot of people play off that,” McMillan said. “But it’s not mine. I could not make a rational decision of something I had no experience of.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sixteen-year-old victim and her boyfriend were abducted from the Overton Park area in Memphis, Tennessee. After having parked near the entrance of the park, they were accosted by a man wielding a knife and forced out of their vehicle. The perpetrator robbed the victim’s boyfriend and forced them both into the woods, where he ordered them to disrobe. He ordered the victim’s boyfriend to lay face down on the ground and proceeded to rape the victim. She was also cut as she struggled with her assailant. As he fled, the assailant ordered them to remain on the ground and not to get dressed until he had gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim and her boyfriend, unable to find their car keys, flagged down a passing car and were driven to her Sunday school teacher’s home.

{"context": "Is hydropower less clean than it seems? A new study synthesizing prior research on water reservoir emissions suggests that they may emit the equivalent of a billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. That’s 1.3 percent of total global emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, which will appear in next week’s BioScience, is the work of 10 authors at universities and institutions in the US, Canada, China, Brazil, and the Netherlands. They argue that reservoir emissions should be included in global carbon budgets, which they currently are not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many nations, particularly in the developing world, depend on hydropower as an affordable source of energy – and a way to meet Paris Accord commitments. If these findings are borne out by further research, they could affect international climate policy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hydropower has historically had proponents and detractors on both sides of the environmental debate. Some point to water-powered turbines as clean and renewable energy, while others criticize the dams and reservoirs that can destroy river ecosystems and displace millions of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Paris Climate Change Conference in December, more than 300 organizations called for large hydropower to be excluded from climate initiatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prospects seem to be improving for dammed rivers, as The Christian Science Monitor’s Cristina Maza reported in May: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Nature Conservancy has collaborated with the Army Corps of Engineers to reduce the impact of the dams already in existence. Their aim is to lower the impacts hydropower has on the environment by changing the way dams operate, helping to restore downstream ecosystems, and removing dams in places that have aging infrastructure that can’t be rehabilitated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one-sixth of the energy mix, hydropower is the world's leading source of renewable power — and another 3,700 dams are being planned or constructed worldwide. So the finding that acre for acre, reservoirs produce 25 percent more methane than previously thought is an important one for the future of the industry and for plans to curb carbon emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What causes a reservoir to emit greenhouse gases? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study’s authors have a provocative new answer. Where older studies had suggested tropical reservoirs were the biggest emitters, the new study finds that the culprits are the plants growing in reservoirs, regardless of latitude. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We were surprised to find that the biological productivity of the reservoir (i.e. how many 'nutrients' like nitrogen and phosphorus the reservoir receives and the associated degree of algae growth) is a better predictor of emissions than is latitude. So, the most biologically productive reservoirs are producing the most methane,” writes Bridget Deemer, the study’s first author, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study authors suggest that Amazonian reservoirs do not emit significantly more methane than non-Amazonian reservoirs, a finding that runs counter to previous work on the topic, she adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methane emissions are particularly high for recently constructed dams. As new reservoirs fill with water, the dams submerge plant and animal life, causing them to decompose and release methane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many developing nations consider damming rivers an easy and affordable source of power. Instead, says Astrid Puentes Riaño, co-executive director of the Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense, countries should meet their needs through a judicious combination of wind, solar, and geothermal power, as well as energy efficiency measures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AIDA is helping to inform countries about what they believe the negative effects of hydropower are, and helping countries find better solutions, she tells the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Particularly in Latin America, “countries are not really looking at [the] best solutions for energy,” she says, but choosing large hydropower installations almost by default. A large part of the solution is finding funds for “small-scale projects that are more community managed,” she adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But other renewable sources also have their detractors. A power outage in South Australia on Wednesday fueled concerns that solar and wind power are untrustworthy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The increasing percentage of power generation from intermittent sources such as solar and wind creates large fluctuations in voltage and frequency, challenging the system,” wrote The Australian on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What long-term effect will the study will have on environmental policy? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Study co-author John Harrison, an associate professor at Washington State University’s School of the Environment, says he is working to update how the UN Environment Program calculates greenhouse gas emissions on the basis of these findings. But more research is needed to compare emissions from dams to those from traditional fuels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the meantime, hydropower remains an attractive option for many countries. Water is one of the few resources available to nations like Kyrgyzstan, one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. In the winter, when hydropower is not an option, the small nation relies on oil and gas from neighboring Kazakhstan, leading to energy shortages. The study’s findings, if integrated into international policy, could have a significant impact on Kyrgyzstan’s ability to meet its climate commitments – and on the country’s bottom line.

Credit: Shelly Hanks, WSU Photo Services Washington State University researchers say the world's reservoirs are an underappreciated source of greenhouse gases, producing the equivalent of roughly 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide a year, or 1.3 percent of all greenhouse gases produced by humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's more greenhouse gas production than all of Canada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Writing in next week's journal BioScience, the WSU researchers say reservoirs are a particularly important source of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the course of a century. Reservoir methane production is comparable to rice paddies or biomass burning, both of which are included in emission estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international authority on the subject. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Harrison, co-author and associate professor in the WSU Vancouver School of the Environment, last month attended a meeting in Minsk, Belarus, to discuss including reservoir emissions in a planned 2019 IPCC update of how countries report their greenhouse gas inventories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methane accounts for 80 percent NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had a sense that methane might be pretty important but we were surprised that it was as important as it was,\" said Bridget Deemer, WSU research associate and lead author. \"It's contributing right around 80 percent of the total global warming impact of all those gases from reservoirs. It's a pretty important piece of the budget.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BioScience analysis, which drew on scores of other studies, is the largest and most comprehensive look to date at the link between reservoirs and greenhouse gases, Harrison said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not only does it incorporate the largest number of studies,\" he said. \"It also looks at more types of greenhouse gases than past studies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acre per acre, reservoirs emit 25 percent more methane than previously thought, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers acknowledge that reservoirs provide important services like electrical power, flood control, navigation and water. But reservoirs have also altered the dynamics of river ecosystems, impacting fish and other life forms. Only lately have researchers started to look at reservoirs' impact on greenhouse gases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While reservoirs are often thought of as 'green' or carbon neutral sources of energy, a growing body of work has documented their role as greenhouse gas sources,\" Deemer, Harrison and their colleagues write. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gases from decomposing organic matter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike natural water bodies, reservoirs tend to have flooded large amounts of organic matter that produce carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as they decompose. Reservoirs also receive a lot of organic matter and \"nutrients\" like nitrogen and phosphorous from upstream rivers, which can further stimulate greenhouse gas production NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2000, BioScience published one of the first papers to assert that reservoir greenhouse gases contribute substantially to global warming. Since then, there has been a nine-fold increase in studies of reservoirs and greenhouse gases. Where earlier studies tended to be confined to reservoirs behind power stations, the newer studies also looked at reservoirs used for flood control, water storage, navigation and irrigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The WSU researchers are the first to consider methane bubbling in models of reservoir greenhouse gas emissions. Also, while previous papers have found that young, tropical reservoirs emit more methane than older, more northern systems, this study finds that the total global warming effect of a reservoir is best predicted by how biologically productive it is, with more algae and nutrient rich systems producing more methane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The authors also report higher per-area rates of methane emission from reservoirs than have been reported previously. This means that acre-for-acre the net effect of new reservoirs on atmospheric greenhouse gases will be greater than previously thought. Reservoir construction around the globe is expected to proceed rapidly in coming decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Largest study of reservoir greenhouse gas emissions NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's been a growing sense in the literature that methane bubbles are a really important component of the total emissions from lake and reservoir ecosystems,\" said Deemer. \"This study revisited the literature to try and synthesize what we know about the magnitude and control on methane emissions and other greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result is that, in addition to being the largest study of reservoir greenhouse gas emissions to date, it is the first to comprehensively look at the flow of all three major greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide—from reservoirs to the atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The work is in keeping with WSU's Grand Challenges, a suite of research initiatives aimed at large societal issues. It is particularly relevant to the challenge of sustainable resources and its themes of supplying food, energy and water for future generations.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| 46? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Donald Trump came along, rich, old, white guys at least dabbled in politics before they tried to become the leader of the free world. But a new path to the presidency has now been paved and we should probably get used to seeing stories like the one in Wednesday’s Hollywood Reporter suggesting that Disney CEO Bob Iger may run for the Democratic nomination in 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last June, the 66-year-old executive told THR that “a lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office,” an early sign that he has the ego to pull off a Trump-like pivot from business to politics. He denied any interest in becoming California’s governor or one of its U.S. senators, but wouldn’t rule out a run for the White House. Since then, Iger has reportedly spoken with Michael Bloomberg, who made the jump from businessman to New York City mayor in 2002, about running for office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given Trump’s path to the presidency, it’s worth noting that Iger just joined Twitter. Is he following Trump’s lead to communicate with voters without a media filter? If so, he’s taking it slow, with only two tweets sent since joining. But if you look closely, a sign of Trump’s influence can be found: He’s used three exclamation points in those two tweets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Iger flirts with a run for office, he’s not the only wealthy, business mogul considering world domination. There have long been rumors about Mark Zuckerberg’s interest in running for president, and now even Oprah is suggesting that a run for the White House might not be out of question. Who’s next? Mark Cuban? Jeff Bezos? We’ll find out soon. It’s only 1,343 days until Election Day."}
{"context": "Donald Trump is going all out to persuade seven-term Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch to seek reelection — a push aimed in no small part at keeping the president’s longtime nemesis, Mitt Romney, out of the Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney has been preparing to run for Hatch’s seat on the long-held assumption that the 83-year-old would retire. Yet Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in history, is now refusing to rule out another campaign — a circumstance Romney’s infuriated inner circle blames squarely on the president. Their suspicions are warranted: Trump has sounded off to friends about how he doesn't like the idea of a Sen. Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president’s mostly behind-the-scenes campaign to sway Hatch will burst into public view on Monday, when he arrives in Salt Lake City to hold a well-choreographed event designed to showcase his affection for the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s appearance is ostensibly official in purpose: He will announce his decision to reduce the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments, a cause that Hatch has championed. But it's also undeniably political: to use the trappings of presidential power to get a veteran lawmaker to rethink his long anticipated plans to leave the Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatch is slated to ride with Trump both ways on Air Force One — a total of roughly nine hours round trip. After descending from the plane together, the two will meet with Mormon leaders and then head to the state Capitol for the signing of the executive order, according to three White House officials. Hatch will introduce Trump, who in turn is expected to lavish praise on the senator. After the order is signed, Hatch is expected to receive the president’s pen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The public display of affection isn’t just about blocking Romney, senior administration officials say. Trump has felt loyal to Hatch since the senator defended him in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape episode late in the 2016 campaign. Hatch stuck by Trump even as other members of Utah’s Republican delegation withdrew their support.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More recently, Hatch has played a key role in moving Trump's prized tax reform bill through the Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump aides say the president's bond with Hatch began long before Romney emerged as a potential successor. Hatch visited Trump in the Oval Office during the first week of his presidency for a lengthy discussion about the then-vacant Supreme Court seat and Utah’s national monuments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet people close to Romney are convinced that Trump’s main motivation is to keep the 2012 GOP presidential nominee out of the Senate. Romney himself has expressed frustration with the ongoing uncertainty about Hatch’s plans, said three Republicans who’ve spoken with him recently. The former Massachusetts governor has pointed out that it was Hatch who urged him to consider running in the first place, but now appears to be wavering on whether to step aside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Hatch is a known entity for Trump and has been really good for the president for the most part,\" said Kirk Jowers, a friend of Romney who formerly served as the chairman and general counsel of his political action committee. \"He knows for a fact he's not going to get that with Romney. I don't know that he knows what he's going to get with Romney, but it's not going to be what he's got with Hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, there’s widespread concern within the White House that Romney in the Senate could make Trump’s life difficult. During the 2016 campaign, the former Massachusetts governor emerged as the de-facto leader of the GOP establishment’s “Never Trump” campaign, delivering a nationally watched speech in which he blasted candidate Trump as a “phony, a fraud” and implored the party to stop him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatch, by contrast, went all-in for Trump in Utah, where Trump received just 46 percent of the vote but still carried the state because of a third-party candidate. Before the election, the senator also campaigned for Trump in four states, hitting the trail with the candidate’s son Donald Trump Jr. While many Republicans air their issues with Trump publicly, Hatch has usually chosen to telegraph his concerns in private discussions with the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll just put it this way. Sen. Hatch was one of the leading voices for the president during the entire campaign,” said Don Peay, a Trump family friend who led his Utah campaign. “Hatch clearly was a strong supporter of Trump from the beginning,” said Peay, who helped to organize Monday’s event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s push to get Hatch to run for an eighth term has taken place in furtive phone calls and West Wing visits. In early October, the senator called the president to invite him to Utah to announce his monument plan, said one person briefed on the discussion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the end of the call, the president conveyed a request. “Orrin,” he said, “I really hope you will consider running again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatch told Trump he hadn't made up his mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their mutual endearment has at times been public. When Hatch was asked last week by reporters about Trump’s decision to retweet several anti-Muslim videos, the senator said he wasn’t “aware” of the firestorm — and then praised Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll say this for ya.’ He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under, and the reason is he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the big boss around here,” Hatch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump responded by tweeting out a video of the remark. “Thank you @SenOrrinHatch,” he added. “Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney’s post-election relationship with Trump has been far more ... complicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the transition, Trump considered appointing Romney secretary of state. Trump was expecting not to like Romney but was surprised by how well they jelled during the interview process, something he told aides repeatedly at the time. Trump ultimately decided against Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the year wore on, the former governor praised the new president for some of his personnel choices. But he also made his differences known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During an appearance in Park City, Utah, in June, Romney told a group of prominent Republican donors that Trump’s White House was too consumed by palace intrigue. He also offered an implicit critique of the president’s “America First” approach to foreign policy, growing emotional as he outlined the country’s humanitarian responsibilities overseas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in August, Romney struck again — this time to implore the president to apologize for equating white supremacists who sowed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their counterprotesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. President,” Romney wrote in a Facebook message, “act now for the good of the country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney has been making the rounds in Utah amid speculation that Hatch is nearing retirement, huddling with an array of Republican figures including state House Speaker Greg Hughes. Romney has told people that while he wouldn’t be reflexively anti-Trump as a senator, he would be more than willing to let his criticisms be known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some Trump allies contend that Utah would be better served by having a presidential loyalist in the seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think he could be a great ally of the president but, as you well know, they're very different people and have very different personalities,\" said Hughes, who recently met with Romney in his office in the state Capitol. \"Sen. Hatch,” he added, “understands the president very well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked who the president would rather have in the seat, Hughes, who was once mentioned as a candidate for a position in the Trump administration, said he had little doubt: \"I think the president enjoys having a strong ally.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney, for his part, won’t be at Monday event. He was invited but, several people close to him said, will be out of town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the weekend, Romney wrote a tweet that underscored his respect for Hatch but also, perhaps, hinted at a belief that the senator had now accomplished what he needed to before moving on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A very big week for Utah’s own Senator @OrrinHatch,” he wrote, “with tax reform, Bears Ears reversion, and a presidential visit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ||||| NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington • When Air Force One descends into Salt Lake City on Monday morning, planes departing and arriving will be held, causing momentary delays for travelers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And President Donald Trump’s motorcade — mixed with pending snow showers — will likely cause some headaches for drivers in Utah’s capital city as he zips around to meet with Mormon church leaders and speak at the state Capitol. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, visiting Utah to announce he’ll shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, will be brief — he’s spending less than three hours on the ground — but will consume the state’s focus for the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Monday marks Trump’s first visit to the state as president, though no public events are scheduled for residents to see him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump arrives just before 11 a.m. Monday at the Utah Air National Guard Base attached to Salt Lake City International Airport. From there, he heads to Welfare Square to meet with officials from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and where he’s expected to take a quick tour of the faith’s humanitarian efforts for the needy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that, Trump will appear at the Capitol to sign an executive order reportedly removing some 2 million acres from the national monuments created by his Democratic predecessors in southern Utah. Sen. Orrin Hatch and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who are traveling with the president from Washington, are expected to speak as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump departs Salt Lake City at 1:35 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Capitol event is open only to invited guests, guaranteeing a friendly crowd excited about the reductions in the monument, as well as pre-credentialed m edia. A protest also is planned in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance told supporters in an email and Facebook post that it is planning a protest starting at 10:45 a.m. just across from the Capitol grounds along 300 North, calling Trump’s actions an “egregious assault on America’s public lands” that amounts to “the largest rollback of protected areas in U.S. history. It is also an appalling affront to Native American tribes who sought healing and cross-cultural understanding through protection of their sacred sites and ancestral homelands.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group cautioned, “This is a peaceful protest. We do not condone violence or destruction of property.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article continues below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, founded by Don Peay, one of Trump’s biggest Utah backers, took out a full-page ad in Utah’s metro newspapers Sunday to thank Trump for “hearing the voice of the Utah people, and for protecting our lands, wildlife and heritage of our public lands.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As with any presidential visit, police are likely to shut down freeways and some roads as Trump and his motorcade move about Salt Lake City. The area around Welfare Square, just west of downtown, and the Capitol are likely to be secured as well."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sentence imposed Thursday by Northumberland County Judge Charles H. Saylor on Miranda Barbour, 19, and her husband Elytte, 22, was anticipated because it is required with a second-degree murder conviction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Barbours in August pleaded guilty to that charge, admitting they killed Troy LaFerrara, 42, of Port Trevorton on Nov. 11 and stealing his wallet. They were facing the possibility of the death penalty if they had been convicted of first-degree murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two also pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated assault, robbery and possession of an instrument of crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Barbours pleaded guilty, they agreed to following description of what happened that November evening: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miranda Barbour arranged through Craigslist to meet LaFerrara in a parking lot along Routes 11-15 north of Selinsgrove. They drove to Sunbury with her husband hiding on the backseat floor under a blanket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When they stopped in Sunbury, Miranda Barbour repeatedly stabbed LaFerrara while her husband restrained him with a piece of television cable around the neck. LaFerrara was left in an alley behind the 200 block of Catawissa Avenue where his body was discovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miranda Barbour later voluntarily confessed, initially claiming she stabbed LaFerrara when he began to grope her and put his hands around her throat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her husband, who was prepared to testify against his wife according to his attorney, told investigators where to find the knife in the attic of a Selinsgrove house where they were staying with others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saylor had ruled both the confession and the knife could be introduced as evidence. There was issue with the search warrant affidavit because it contained a different Selinsgrove address. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two had moved to Selinsgrove from North Carolina where they had gotten married three weeks before LaFerrara was killed.

It's come from someone else.\"Elizabeth said she took Miranda to many therapists over the years to get her the help she needed.\"I love Miranda,\" she said. \"I will never turn my back on her. She's my daughter.\"Barbour, 19, and her husband, Elytte, have been charged with the Nov. 11 murder of Troy LeFerrara, 42, whom they allegedly met via a Craigslist ad and lured to his death. They have both pleaded not guilty.In February, Miranda told a Pennsylvania newspaper reporter she killed at least 21 other people . While Ashley and their mother believe Miranda killed LeFerrara, they do not believe she killed anyone else.\"My daughter is not a serial killer,\" Elizabeth Dean told McGraw. \"I don't believe Miranda has killed more than one person because this one is so sloppy.\"Neither does McGraw, who read Miranda's journal dating back to May 8, 2010, which Elizabeth Dean says she found earlier this year.\"Nowhere in there is there one word, one syllable, one even veiled reference to having killed anyone,\" McGraw said. \"It seems to me, given the candor of some of these entries, that would be an odd thing to leave out.\"McGraw also read an email his show received from Miranda on Nov. 10, 2012, pleading for help for her mother, whom she called a \"pill-popping drunk.\"\"She's so verbally abusive and it hurts so much,\" the email said. \"If things keep going the way they are she's going to kill herself ... I don't know how to help her.\"Elizabeth says she was taking medication for a medical condition and was drinking at the time.\"I was very depressed,\" she said.McGraw said his show reached out to Miranda after receiving the email but was not able to make contact with her.Ashley said similar things about their mother and added that she and her sister were both sexually assaulted by an uncle when she was 6 and Miranda was 3. He went to prison for nine years.\"You have to understand where Miranda's coming from,\" Ashley explained. \"You have to understand what happened to her when she was younger.\"Both Miranda and her husband face the death penalty.

{"context": "Officially, aliens have never existed but flying saucers very nearly did. The National Archives has recently published never-before-seen schematics and details of a 1950s military venture, called Project 1794, which aimed to build a supersonic flying saucer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newly declassified materials show the U.S. Air Force had a contract with a now-defunct Canadian company to build an aircraft unlike anything seen before. Project 1794 got as far as the initial rounds of product development and into prototype design. In a memo dating from 1956 the results from pre-prototype testing are summarized and reveal exactly what the developers had hoped to create. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The saucer was supposed to reach a top speed of “between Mach 3 and Mach 4, a ceiling of over 100,000 ft. and a maximum range with allowances of about 1,000 nautical miles,” according to the document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the plans had followed through to completion they would have created a saucer, which could spin through the Earth’s stratosphere at an average top speed of about 2,600 miles per hour. Wow. It was also designed to take off and land vertically (VTOL), using propulsion jets to control and stabilize the aircraft. Admittedly the range of 1,000 nautical miles seems limited in comparison to the other specifications – but if you’d hopped on the disk in New York it could’ve had you in Miami within about 24 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The document also hints that the product development seemed to be going better than planned; “the present design will provide a much superior performance to that estimated at the start of contract negotiations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It begs the question – why was the project dropped? Why aren’t wars being fought with flying saucers? The cost of continuing to prototype was estimated at $3,168,000, which roughly translates to about $26.6 million in today’s money and wouldn’t have been an insane price for such advanced technology. The problem with the other flying saucers developed under the same program (see video) is pretty clear. They didn’t get anywhere near 100,000 feet in altitude, more like five or six if you were lucky – so the military finally pulled the plug in 1960. ||||| Aero Sys Div, 1969 (RG 342 UD-UP 138; NND 63253; Boxes 35 and 58) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Michael Rhodes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recently declassified records from the Aeronautical Systems Division, USAF (RG 342 – Records of United States Air Force Commands, Activities, and Organizations) reveal some surprising, perhaps never-before-seen images: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ﻿ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The above illustration was discovered in the pages of a document titled “Project 1794, Final Development Summary Report” (d.1956) The caption reads “USAF Project 1794”.

{"context": "For Jamie Heutmaker, Thursday was 49 years in the making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a hot summer’s day in 1969, Heutmaker, then 14, and one of his peers were sexually abused by a priest from the Church of St. Mark in St. Paul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the Rev. Jerome Kern’s conduct was reported to Catholic Church staff by his parents, it wasn’t until now, Heutmaker said, that he felt some measure of justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It feels really good to be here today,” Heutmaker, now 62, said tearfully amid a crowd of survivors of clergy sexual abuse gathered in a downtown St. Paul law office Thursday afternoon. “Never in my life did I think it would come to this, 49 years later. … I am extremely grateful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Led by their attorneys, including Jeff Anderson, the group gathered to announce a historic $210 million settlement in the bankruptcy battle between 450 survivors of clergy sexual abuse and the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agreement comes after three years of legal wrangling in federal bankruptcy court. The two sides sought an agreement on how much the archdiocese should pay to survivors who endured both abuse at the hands of clergy and the subsequent cover-up of the conduct by archdiocesan staff, including former Archbishop John Nienstedt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For survivors, such as Heutmaker, the fight began long before that and involved more than legal sparring. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He thanked his parents, friends, attorneys, fellow survivors and wife for standing by him as he battled years of anxiety, depression and thoughts of suicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Without all of you I don’t think I would be standing here today,” Heutmaker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anderson cried and hugged Heutmaker and other survivors as he discussed the resolution. The agreement was negotiated by attorneys for both sides as well as members of the creditors committee, a group composed of five abuse survivors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It really is a story of trauma and triumph,” Anderson said of the path to the settlement. It’s the largest ever reached by a Catholic archdiocese going through bankruptcy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am almost at a loss for some words because there are some feelings that are overwhelming me at this moment,” Anderson continued. “Four hundred and fifty survivors have found their voice and expressed their voice and … as a result, we have reached a negotiated settlement that not only includes accountability and financial accountability, but it actually advances the (cause) of child protection in a way that has never really been done in this country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials with the archdiocese said the resolution effectively ends all litigation pending against the local church and its parishes and allows everyone involved to enter the next phase of healing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archbishop Bernard Hebda apologized to survivors at a news conference held outside the archdiocese’s St. Paul offices later Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Without (your) courage and persistence, today would not have been possible,” said Hebda, who was named to lead the archdiocese after Nienstedt’s resignation three years ago. “I recognize that the abuse stole so much from you. … Your childhood, your innocence, your safety, your ability to trust … and in many ways, your faith.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted that many lives were forever changed by the abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The church let you down,” Hebda said. “I am very sorry.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Details of how the settlement will be allocated to survivors and how much will cover attorney fees are still being determined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FUNDS WILL BE DISBURSED NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the coming days, officials on both sides will work out the details of the agreement, which still needs to be approved by a federal bankruptcy court judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tom Abood, chair of the Archdiocesan Finance Council and Reorganization Task Force, said the $210 million will be placed in a trust fund and disbursed to victims by an independent trustee, possibly beginning in the coming months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abood led the final stretch of negotiations for the archdiocese, which he said took 18 days to reach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The payout is about $50 million more than the last plan presented by the archdiocese, which both the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case and survivors maintained was insufficient. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge also rejected the plan submitted by survivors, which called for the archdiocese alone to contribute up to $80 million. The judge directed both sides back to the negotiating table in December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the sticking points in the past was how much exposure the archdiocese and its parishes’ insurance companies should have in the settlement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About $170 million of the payout will be covered by insurance carriers under the terms of the agreement, Abood said, with the other $40 million coming from the archdiocese and its parishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where that money will come from inside those organizations wasn’t immediately clear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abood listed an archdiocesan medical benefits plan, cash the archdiocese has on hand, as well as profits from the sales of land and property as some sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the archdiocese and its parishes rely on donations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it’s a big financial hit, the archdiocese can endure it, Abood said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We will have to work hard … to make our budget work, but we will do it and Catholics in this community can be confident that we will be moving forward responsibly with our budget and that individual parishes will do the same.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Far more important than the payout to survivors are the protections now in place for children within the archdiocese as well as the exposure of the priests and staff who either abused minors or covered up such conduct, Anderson and survivors said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They pointed to the agreement reached between the Ramsey County attorney’s office and the archdiocese in 2015 as a key component to the creation of a safer environment for youth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That settlement came about six months after the county attorney’s office filed six gross misdemeanor charges against the archdiocese for failing to adequately protect three children sexually abused by former priest Curtis Wehmeyer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the terms: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That the archdiocese adopt new protocols for reporting and responding to allegations of clergy abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That archdiocesan officials regularly visit all of their parishes and schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A requirement of background checks and child safety training for all staff and publish statements in the Catholic Spirit — the archdiocese’s newspaper — urging victims of sexual abuse to report conduct to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An audit conducted earlier this year found the archdiocese to so far be “substantially compliant” in those efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jim Keenan, chairman of the creditors committee and an abuse survivor, also touted the survivors’ courage to reject the archdiocese’s initial payout proposal as a critical turning point for victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That hadn’t been done before. It was a first,” Keenan said. “It changed the playing field. They have to listen to victims now … and (that’s) worth more than the (settlement amount).” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday’s announcement affirmed that the years of “emotional energy” he’s poured into this cause were worth it, Keenan added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think it shows (that) if anyone out there wonders, ‘Do I have the legs to stand up … (for) my voice?’ You absolutely do,” Keenan said. “Speak your truth, because what happens is you may make change. I really do believe we have made the world safer in the (Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis).” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHANGE TO STATE LAW PROMPTED LAWSUITS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The archdiocese faced numerous lawsuits after Minnesota lawmakers in 2013 created a three-year window for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that otherwise would have been invalid due to the statute of limitations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The onslaught compelled the archdiocese to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015, becoming the 12th U.S. diocese or archdiocese at the time to seek reorganization following numerous sex abuse claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bankruptcy case proceeded slowly as attorneys argued over how much money the archdiocese should have to pay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 15 dioceses or archdioceses across the country have filed for bankruptcy, including three in Minnesota, as they sought to protect themselves from growing claims of sexual abuse by clergy members. A fourth Minnesota diocese, St. Cloud, announced its intention to file in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the website BishopAccountability.org, which tracks clergy sex abuse cases, this is the largest settlement among the archdioceses and dioceses that have filed for bankruptcy protection.

(Photo: Aaron Lavinsky, Star Tribune via AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis says it has agreed to pay a $210 million settlement to 450 victims of clergy sexual abuse, one of the largest payouts to date in the U.S. over the Catholic church’s priest abuse scandal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The settlement, which is expected to be approved by a federal judge overseeing the case, resolves a years-long dispute and is being carried out as part of the Twin Cities archdiocese’s bankruptcy reorganization. Diocese officials say that about $40 million will be paid by the archdiocese, while the other $170 million will come from the archdiocese’s insurers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I recognize that the abuse stole so much from you — your childhood, your innocence, your safety, your ability to trust, and in many cases your faith,\" said Archbishop Bernard Hebda, in announcing the settlement. “Relationships with family and friends, relationships in your parishes and communities were harmed, lives were forever changed. The church let you down. I am very sorry.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The settlement comes after the Minnesota Legislature in 2013 opened a three-year window in the statute of limitations that allowed alleged victims of prior abuse to sue for damages. That measure resulted in hundreds of claims being lodged against the archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy in 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, a federal appeals court affirmed a December 2017 decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Kressel that the parishes and other nonprofit entities were independent, and their assets could not be exposed in the bankruptcy case. The judge in his December ruling rejected the competing reorganization plans filed by the archdiocese and a creditors’ committee and ordered both sides back into mediation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, several who said they were abused by priests they had entrusted expressed a measure of relief over the settlement, while also noting that the trauma of abuse has left an indelible mark on their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There have been so many times that what was done to me has interfered with the joy of being a mother,” said Marie Mielke, a sexual abuse survivor who says she was groomed by a priest she when she was just 12 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eighteen U.S. dioceses and religious orders have filed for bankruptcy protection during the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic church, according to the web site BishopAccountability.org, which tracks sexual abuse cases.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Anderson, an attorney representing the victims, said the archdiocese listed 91 Twin Cities clergy who were credibly accused of sexual abuse.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gabrielle Begue describes her costume as \"shrubs, greens, topiary\" although she conceded that the leaves festooned around her body were a bit unruly to be called topiary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Begue and her husband, Erik Winkowski, were dressed as what could best be described as large bushes put together with fake ivy and the liberal use of a glue gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Begue said with all of the year's heated political commentary they wanted outfits that were \"full whimsical.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The St. Anne's parade is a walking parade that goes from the Bywater and Marigny neighborhoods into the French Quarter and features people wearing an eclectic mix of homemade costumes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weather is supposed to be good, and tens of thousands of people are expected to line parade routes trying to catch colorful beads, Moon Pies and Mardi Gras trinkets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alabama parades also are planned in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach on the Baldwin County side of Mobile Bay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Orleans gets most of the crowds and attention around Mardi Gras, but Mobile bills itself as having the nation's oldest Mardi Gras celebration.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the small town of Hickman, Kentucky, officials and volunteers spent nearly two weeks piling sandbags on top of each other to shore up the 17-mile (27.4-kilometer) levee, preparing for a disaster of historic proportion. About 75 residents were told to flee town and waited anxiously for days to see just how bad the flooding would be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Saturday, the levee had held, and officials boasted that only a few houses appeared to be damaged. More importantly, no one was injured or killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have held back the Mississippi River and that's a feat,\" Fulton County's emergency management director Hugh Caldwell said. \"We didn't beat it, but it didn't beat us. We'll call it a draw.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Downstream, though, there was danger, in places like Memphis, Tennessee, the Mississippi Delta and Louisiana. In Arkansas, authorities recovered the body of a man who drove around barricades earlier in the week and was swept away by floodwaters when he tried to walk out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Memphis Mayor A C Wharton warned residents in low-lying areas to evacuate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR William Owen, 53, didn't heed the call until firefighters began to bang on his door Saturday morning. Owen said when he went to sleep, the water wasn't that high. By midday, it had risen about a foot (30 centimeters), and was around the base of his home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He grabbed his medication and took a city bus, along with his girlfriend and dog, to a shelter. He was told he may have to stay for two weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It seems like we've had a stroke of bad luck,\" Owen said. \"I'm hoping things will get better, I just don't know what else to do right now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Record river levels, some dating as far back as the 1920s, were expected to be broken in some parts along the river. In Memphis, the river was expected to crest at 48 feet (14.6 meters) on Wednesday, just shy of the 48.7-foot (14.8-meter) record from the devastating flood of 1937. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was also a chance Memphis residents might see rain Saturday, though forecasters said the small amount moisture wouldn't affect flooding. There was other good news, too: the forecast was dry until Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Graceland, Elvis Presley's home and one of Memphis' best-known landmarks, is about a 20-minute drive from the river and in no danger of flooding. Water pooled at the lowest end of Beale Street, the thoroughfare synonymous with Mississippi blues, but it was about a half-mile (800 meters) from the street's world-famous nightspots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 100 miles(160 kilometers) to the north, residents in Tiptonville, Tennessee, were hopeful as the river levels started to fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like many other areas along the Mississippi, the town wasn't completely spared. In Tiptonville, an estimated one-fifth of the town has suffered some flooding. All told, 75 homes have been swamped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 30 miles (50 kilometers) of county roads were cut off and impassable, and fields of corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton have been drowned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the Tiptonville homes were inundated with rainwater, not from the Mississippi. Because the levees' gates are closed, the town relied on pumps to move the near constant rain over the past couple of weeks, but they couldn't keep up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere, officials in Louisiana warned residents that even if a key spillway northwest of Baton Rouge was opened, residents should expect floods comparable to those of 1973. Some of Louisiana's most valuable farmland is expected to be inundated with water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the Morganza spillway could be opened as soon as Thursday, but a decision has not been made. If it is opened, it could stay open for weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A separate spillway northwest of New Orleans was to be opened Monday, helping ease the pressure on levees there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To the north in Arkansas, a portion of Interstate 40 remained closed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the billions of dollars spent on levees and other flood defenses built over the years, engineers say it is unlikely any major metropolitan areas will be inundated as the water pushes downstream over the next week or two, but farms, small towns and even some urban areas could see extensive flooding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, a disaster that killed hundreds, Congress has made protecting the cities on the lower Mississippi a priority. The Army Corps of Engineers has spent $13 billion to fortify cities with floodwalls and carve out overflow basins and ponds _ a departure from the \"levees-only\" strategy that led to the 1927 calamity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Corps also straightened out sections of the river that used to meander and pool perilously. As a result, the Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico faster, and water presses against the levees for shorter periods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 4 million people live in 63 counties and parishes adjacent to the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers from Cairo, Illinois south to the Gulf of Mexico, down from 4.1 million in 2000, according to a census analysis by The Associated Press.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a pretty day here, and people get a false sense of security,” said Steve Shular, public affairs officer for the Shelby County Office of Preparedness. “The mighty Mississippi is starting to wrap its arms around us here in Memphis.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 3,000 properties are expected to be threatened. Rising water flooded 25 mobile homes in north Memphis Saturday morning. There were 367 people in shelters in Shelby County Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our community is facing what could be a large-scale disaster,” said Shelby County Mayor Mark H. Luttrell, Jr., in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Water has covered Riverside Drive and is creeping up Beale Street, although below the level of businesses and residences. Most of downtown Memphis is on a bluff, so landmarks like historic Sun Studio, where music legends Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash got their starts, were not seeing flooding. Tour guide Jake Fly said people north and south of the city are “really feeling it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re all hoping this river is going to crest soon, man,” said Fly. “Man, it’s something to see.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Weather Service forecast that the river will crest Wednesday in Memphis at 48 feet, just under the 1937 record. No significant rain is forecast for the next few days in the area. The weather service expects record crests in Mississippi at Vicksburg on May 20 and Natchez on May 22. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No deaths or injuries have been reported in the Memphis flooding, but the spectacle has drawn sightseers — an activity being discouraged by emergency officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Most of the tourists weren’t trying to visit the clubs on Beale Street, but they were trying to touch the water,” said Joseph Braslow, 20, son of one of the owners of A. Schwab Dry Goods on Beale Street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further north in Missouri, the river was cresting Saturday afternoon at Caruthersville, said Ryan Husted, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Memphis. New Madrid, Missouri and Tiptonville, Tenn. crested at 48.35 Saturday and levels are falling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Coast Guard closed a portion of the Ohio River Saturday. The Coast Guard closed the Mississippi at Caruthersville briefly Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shular said a major concern is flooding along the tributaries of the Mississippi. These smaller streams and rivers usually flow into the larger river, but are “hitting a brick wall” and backing up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Arkansas, a portion of Interstate 40, a major national road artery for trucking, remained closed on Saturday due to flood waters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the state of Mississippi, over 2,000 residents will have to evacuate as the river continues to rise, according to Jeff Rent, director for external affairs for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It will be much higher” than 2,000, Rent said. “There just does not seem to be an end to these emergencies lately.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A snowy winter spawned near-record crests on the Upper Mississippi this year that reached southern Illinois at about the same time as heavy rain swelled the Ohio River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The resulting flows have threatened to overwhelm the intricate flood levee system, prompting the U.S. government to open a Missouri floodway for the first time since 1937 to relieve pressure. U.S. officials are expected to activate three floodways this year for the first time in history.

{"context": "Over the past 30 years, three-quarters of eastern US tree species have been shifting to the west, and at an astonishing rate of around 15.4 kilometres per decade (9.5 miles). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's weird, because scientists have long predicted that the effects of climate change would send species towards the poles in search of familiar climates, but since 1980, more eastern trees have been moving west instead of north. And at this stage, it's not entirely clear why. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fact that more eastern trees are moving westward than northward isn't even the strangest part. Researchers estimate that even if we took certain knock-on effects of climate change into consideration, such as changes in rainfall and precipitation, it can only explain a fraction of the movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Something else is going on here - or many somethings in accumulation - and scientists are still trying to make sense of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[It] was a huge surprise for us,\" lead researcher Songlin Fei, a forest ecologist from Purdue University, told Emma Marris at Nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fei and his team analysed 30 years' worth of data from the US Forest Service, which covered the movements of 86 tree species between 1980 and 2015. These trees were located between Maine and Minnesota, and as far south as Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They found that more species had made shifts towards the west than to the north during this period, and the young trees were more likely to have made this westward migration than the older ones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some trees made their way in both directions, towards the northwest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We show that more tree species have experienced a westward shift (73 percent) than a poleward shift (62 percent) in their abundance, a trend that is stronger for saplings than adult trees,\" the researchers report in their paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, to be clear, trees don't migrate by hitching up their roots and trudging through the forest like IRL Ents - but they are known for gradually shifting their population centres over many years to places that offer better conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When times get tough in one area, saplings will start cropping up in another, more suitable habitat, and once the older population dies out, the species will have established a new home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The process, while gradual, is happening faster than you might think in the eastern US, with Fei and his team finding that westward-moving trees have been shifting at a rate of 15.4 km per decade, while northward-moving trees have been clearing about 11 km per decade (6.8 miles). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hardly any of the species made a break for the south or east during this time period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also found that between 1980 and 2015, the mean annual temperature in the eastern US increased by about 0.16 degrees Celsius on average (0.29 degrees Fahrenheit). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conventional wisdom states that as the temperature rises, species that are used to the cold will move further north, away from the tropics, but that's not what happened here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an effort to explain the westward charge, the Purdue researchers hypothesise that precipitation changes brought on by global warming could be at play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While climate change has elevated temperatures across the eastern US, it has significantly altered rainfall totals,\" Robinson Meyer reports for The Atlantic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The northeast has gotten a little more rain since 1980 than it did during the proceeding century, while the southeast has gotten much less rain. The Great Plains, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas, get much more than historically normal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Different species are responding to climate change differently. Most of the broad-leaf species - deciduous trees - are following moisture moving westward,\" Fei told him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The evergreen trees - the needle species - are primarily moving northward.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That makes sense, but there's one catch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fei says his team could only argue that \"at least 20 percent\" of the shift in population could be explained by human-caused precipitation changes, because one fact remains - while the west is now wetter than it used to be it's still not wetter than where the trees were originally in the east. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fei says each species responds to the pressures of climate change and other aspects of human activity differently, meaning the causes behind this phenomenon are far more nuanced than rising temperatures moving things one way or another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Trees are shifting partially because of climate change, but their responses are species specific,\" he explains in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's likely that the migration is down to a number of factors, such as changes in how we're using the land, new pest infestations, and conservation and planting projects - something that future research will need to model extensively before we can know for sure why trees are moving the way they are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the team is careful to point out that just because we can't slap a \"100 percent climate change is to blame\" stamp on this one doesn't mean that we can get complacent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is still some skepticism out there about climate change,\" Fei told Kate Lunau at Motherboard. \"[W]e're saying, let's look at what's actually happened. We wanted to show the reality, not speculations.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And when you see the rapid changes in the environment in response to climate change, she adds, \"Is our society ready to adapt?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research has been published in Science Advances. ||||| The United States has a long, fraught history of westward movement. But what happens when the movers are not people, but plants? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, reports Robinson Meyer of The Atlantic, it seems that American trees are doing the same thing. No, they’re not sentient—and they don't care about Manifest Destiny. But the abundance of common species of American trees has shifted westward in recent years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a new study in the journal Science Advances, researchers used two national tree censuses—one inventory taken between 1980 and 1995, the other finished in 2015. Of 86 species tracked in both inventories, including the shortleaf pine, black ash, sassafras and silver maples, 73 percent shifted westward, and 62 percent shifted northward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this case, “shift” means expand its growth into a new area as other trees die off elsewhere. “The research team compared a tree population to a line of people stretching from Atlanta to Indianapolis,” explains Meyer. “Even if everyone in the line stood still, if you added new people to the end of the line in Indiana and asked others in Georgia to leave, then the center of the line would move nonetheless.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But why are they moving to begin with? The answer is unsatisfying: Researchers aren’t really sure. Climate change does seem to be a factor. Scientists have long predicted that plants will migrate in response to warming temperatures. However, it’s hard to tease out why plants that have moved did so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Climate can impact trees in different ways, inflicting drought or whipping up wind, but the U.S. Forest Service notes that insects, diseases and changing wildfire patterns can indirectly affect their range, too. Though the researchers hypothesize that young trees adapt to climate change more readily than their older counterparts, there’s a lot of variability at play. They suggest that everything from how areas manage fires to the presence of invasive species might spur trees to move—and any of those variables may or may not be caused by climate change. Increasing rainfall in the West, and decreasing moisture in the East, seems to be driving the movement, but it’s not clear how much that contributes to the shift. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, another clue points to climate as the underlying cause. The trees’ northward shift lines up with scientists’ long-term predictions. Since plants only thrive in a certain, relatively narrow band of temperatures, wisdom has it that they’ll move to find those cool temperatures over time. And as the global temperature warms, those kinds of shifts can be seen in animals like fish and birds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for the trees, it remains unclear if climate change is really driving them to blaze a westward trail. With the Earth warming faster than ever before, however, scientists may have answers before long. ||||| Abstract Climate change can have profound impacts on biodiversity and the sustainability of many ecosystems. Various studies have investigated the impacts of climate change, but large-scale, trait-specific impacts are less understood. We analyze abundance data over time for 86 tree species/groups across the eastern United States spanning the last three decades. We show that more tree species have experienced a westward shift (73%) than a poleward shift (62%) in their abundance, a trend that is stronger for saplings than adult trees. The observed shifts are primarily due to the changes of subpopulation abundances in the leading edges and are significantly associated with changes in moisture availability and successional processes. These spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar traits (drought tolerance, wood density, and seed weight) and evolutionary histories (most angiosperms shifted westward and most gymnosperms shifted poleward). Our results indicate that changes in moisture availability have stronger near-term impacts on vegetation dynamics than changes in temperature. The divergent responses to climate change by trait- and phylogenetic-specific groups could lead to changes in composition of forest ecosystems, putting the resilience and sustainability of various forest ecosystems in question.

Many studies have investigated the impacts of global temperature rise and suggested that species will migrate poleward (higher latitude) and upward (higher elevation) (3–7). However, climate change incorporates both temperature and precipitation (8), and the responses to climate change are likely to be trait-specific (9, 10). In the last 30 years, the mean annual temperature (MAT) in the eastern United States has increased about 0.16°C on average, with the northern region undergoing the highest temperature increase (Fig. 1A). Precipitation patterns have also changed, with an increase of more than 150-mm total annual precipitation (TAP) in the central United States and a large reduction in the southeast (Fig. 1B). The combined shifts in precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures have resulted in widespread droughts, as measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) in the southeastern region of the study area (fig. S1), which can be detrimental to various ecosystems (11–13). Therefore, taking only temperature into consideration is likely to result in an underestimation of the impacts of climate change on species distributions (14–16). Fig. 1 Changes in temperature and precipitation across the eastern United States. (A) Changes in MAT and (B) TAP between the recent past (1951–1980) and the study period (1981–2014). In addition, variations in physiological traits (for example, thermal tolerance) can result in trait-specific responses to climate change (10, 17). Pollen records indicated that different tree species had differential patterns of migration and range shifts in response to changes in the late Quaternary climate (18). These different patterns were likely driven by trait dissimilarities among species. For example, gymnosperms generally have slower juvenile maximum growth rate than angiosperms (19), nearly all gymnosperms are wind-pollinated whereas many angiosperms are insect-pollinated, and gymnosperms have greater hydraulic safety margins than angiosperms in response to drought (11). Tremendous variability also exists within the gymnosperm and angiosperm tree lineages in response to different environmental conditions because of their varying functional traits (20). Hence, the realized current and near-term, broad-scale climate change impacts on vegetation dynamics will likely be trait- and lineage-specific. For tree species, upward and poleward shifts have been observed, but with some inconsistencies. Upward shifts of trees, primarily in response to temperature change, have been observed in a wide range of studies (4, 21), but downward shifts have also been observed as a result of tracking moisture (22). Poleward shifts of tree species have also been observed worldwide but with some exceptions (7, 15). For example, Woodall et al. (23) found that in the eastern United States, the mean latitude of seedlings shifted greater than 20 km north for the northern species, whereas southern species did not move; Zhu et al. (24) found no indication of tree range expansion. The impacts of climate change on trees can be complicated, as different combinations of alterations in temperature and precipitation can result in different impacts (15) and different tree species can have different responses to climate change (25). To complicate things further, species range shift can also be affected by other nonclimatic factors. In particular, successional processes, influenced by various types of disturbances (or lack of disturbances) along with land use changes, could play an important role in species recruitment, dispersal, and abundance change (26, 27). Here, we analyzed the distributions of 86 tree species/groups across the eastern United States over the last three decades to (i) investigate the magnitude and directionality of their responses to climate change while accounting for successional processes and (ii) provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed spatial shift. Past studies have primarily focused on the leading and trailing edges of species distributions (14). We used tree abundance data to quantify species response to climate change because quantitative changes within species ranges are more informative (6), can be considerable without any observable changes in overall range extent (28), and are likely to represent intermediate states in species range shifts (14, 29). We hypothesized that (i) young trees have more prominent responses to climate change than adult trees and (ii) species that experience similar responses to climate change share similar physiological traits and evolutionary histories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RESULTS Spatial patterns of shift We observed a prominent westward and poleward shift in abundance for most tree species in the eastern United States during the last 30 years (Fig. 2). Of the 86 species studied, 73% shifted their abundance centers westward, of which 65% were statistically significant (P < 0.05), whereas 62% shifted poleward, of which 55% were significant (table S1A). The median longitudinal rate for species that shifted westward (15.4 km per decade) was 40% larger than the median latitudinal rate for species that shifted poleward (11.0 km per decade). The primary direction of species abundance shift was northwest (37% of the species), and the least common direction was southeast (2%). Fig. 2 Rose diagrams depicting the direction and distance of abundance shifts for 86 species. Spatial shift of species abundance for (A) all stems, (B) saplings, and (C) adult trees between two inventory periods (1980s and 2010s). Color represents the different distance categories, and wedge width represents the proportion of species in each direction-distance category. Further examination of tree abundances within the four cardinal quadrants of each species distribution range indicates that the observed spatial shifts are primarily due to changes in subpopulations at the leading edges (Fig. 3). In general, subpopulations in the northwestern quadrant had the highest rate of poleward and westward shifts (median, 6.9 and 15.7 km per decade, respectively) compared to subpopulations in other quadrants (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, the northwestern subpopulations within each species range had the highest increase in stem density (median, 24%), whereas other subpopulations had low increases (5.6 and 8.1% in the northeastern and southwestern quadrants, respectively) or were nearly flat (0.6% in the southeastern quadrant) (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3 Spatial shift of species abundance by subpopulations. (A) Latitudinal shift and (B) longitudinal shift of species abundance center and (C) relativity stem density change by subpopulations (four quadrants that are defined by species density center at T1). Positive values indicate northward or eastward shift, and negative values indicate southward or westward shift in (A) and (B). Different letters represent significant differences according to the Tukey post hoc test using glht in R. NW, northwestern; NE, northeastern; SW, southwestern; SE, southeastern. We also observed regional differences in species abundance shifts (Fig. 4). The majority of species (85%) centered in the warm continental Northern Hardwood region shifted their abundance poleward at a median rate of 20.1 km per decade. Species centered in the hot continental Central Hardwood region shifted primarily westward (83%) at a median rate of 18.9 km per decade. Similarly, species centered in the subtropical Southern Pine-Hardwood region also had a primarily westward shift (77%) at a median rate of 24.7 km per decade. Species centered in the Forest-Prairie Transition region had a westward shift at a median rate of 30.0 km per decade. Fig. 4 Shift of species mean abundance center by ecoprovinces in the eastern United States during the last three decades. 210, Northern Hardwood region; 220, Central Hardwood region; 230, Southern Pine-Hardwood region; 250, Forest-Prairie Transition region (44, 51). All three species centered in ecoprovince 250 shifted westward (rose diagram not shown). “Si*” indicates that the shift is statistically significant (P < 0.05). NS, nonsignificant. Sapling-sized trees had a slightly higher proportion but longer distance in westward and poleward shifts than adults (Fig. 2, B and C, and table S1A). About 71% of tree species shifted their sapling abundance westward versus 70% for adult trees (61 and 65% were significant, respectively, at P < 0.05). Similarly, 59% of species shifted their sapling abundance poleward versus 56% for adults (57 and 58% were significant, respectively, at P < 0.05). The median westward and poleward shift distances for saplings (20.7 and 13.1 km per decade, respectively) were longer than those for adults (15.6 and 12.5 km per decade, respectively; table S1A). A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that the westward shift distances for sapling and adult tree abundance were statistically different (P = 0.063). Associations with climate variables and forest succession Changes in species abundance during the study period are related to climatic conditions (Fig. 5). With some exceptions, species located in higher temperature and precipitation climatic space experienced reductions in abundance, as indicated by the species’ density change. On the other hand, species located in the lower temperature and precipitation climatic space experienced increases (Fig. 5A). Among 38 species associated with mean temperature and precipitation less than the median values (the lower left part of Fig. 5A), 84% experienced an increase in their total stem density. Fig. 5 Relationships between climate variables and species abundance change (shaded area indicates 95% confidence interval). (A) Relative changes in species density [(Density_T2 − Density_T1)/Density_T1 × 100)] in association with species MAT and TAP at T1 within the overlapped species distribution range at T1 and T2. Dot size is proportional to the relative density change. Red and green represent negative and positive change in the relative density, respectively. (B) Positive association between relative changes in species density and changes in species’ respective TAP. (C) Positive association between relative changes in species density and changes in total tree stem density. Changes in species abundance had a stronger association with moisture (precipitation and drought index) than with temperature (Fig. 5B and fig. S2). Changes in TAP were positively associated with changes in species abundance, explaining about 19% of the variability in abundance change (Fig. 5B). The majority of species (80%) that experienced an increase in TAP over 40 mm in their distribution ranges underwent an increase in abundance, and all species increased in abundance when precipitation increased over 60 mm. Not surprisingly, changes in drought condition (PDSI) were also positively associated with species abundance changes (r2 = 0.19; fig. S2A), because of the highly correlated nature between TAP and PDSI. The association between changes in temperature (MAT) and species abundance was significant but weak (r2 = 0.05; fig. S2B). Forest successional processes, as approximated by stem density and basal area of all overstory trees, also had influences on the observed species abundance shift. Changes in species abundance were positively related to the changes in overall stem density but negatively related to the changes in total basal area (Fig. 5C and fig. S2C), indicating that forests in relatively early successional stages (that is, rapid increases in density but low accumulations in basal area) had more gains in abundance of the studied species than forests in late successional stages. A multiple regression analysis further confirmed that changes in TAP and total stem density were positively associated with changes in species abundance (table S2). Trait-specific shifts The observed spatial shifts in species abundance are associated with certain functional traits that are related to physiological tolerance and dispersal ability. In general, species that shifted westward had a larger seed size (P = 0.012) and higher wood density (P = 0.039) than species that shifted eastward. For species that shifted significantly eastward and westward, the median value for seed weight is 0.007 and 0.069 g per seed, and the median value for wood density is 0.47 and 0.51 g/cm3, respectively (fig. S3). In addition, species with different degrees of drought tolerance had different westward shift rates, where species with low drought tolerance had the lowest westward shift rate (median rate, 2.6 km per decade) compared to the medium and high drought tolerance groups (median rate, 14.3 and 11.6 km per decade, respectively) (fig. S4). On the other hand, species that shifted northward had a lower maximum annual precipitation (P < 0.01) and lower wood density (P = 0.055) than species that shifted southward (primarily southwest). The median maximum annual precipitation is 1524 and 2032 mm/year, and the median wood density is 0.49 and 0.56 g/cm3, respectively, for species that shifted significantly northward and southward (fig. S5). In addition, wind-pollinated species primarily shifted northward, whereas animal-pollinated species shifted southward (fig. S6). All other investigated traits (see details in table S3) are not significantly associated with the observed shifts (P > 0.1), except for maximum elevation of species distribution, which is marginally significant (P = 0.085). We also detected a small but statistically significant phylogenetic signal of longitudinal shifts in species abundance (K = 0.023, P = 0.004), but no such signal for latitudinal shifts (K = 0.007, P = 0.760). In other words, members of some evolutionary groups exhibit relatively consistent westward or eastward shifts (Fig. 6). Fifty-three of the 65 angiosperm species (81.5%) shifted westward, 34 (52.3%) of which significantly shifted, whereas 10 of the 21 gymnosperm species shifted westward. At a finer evolutionary resolution, all 13 red oak species (section Lobatae) had westward movement, with 53.8% (7 species) being statistically significant, whereas 3 of the 9 white oaks (section Quercus) moved east. Meanwhile, all the members of the Fabaceae, Juglandaceae, and Lauraceae, and most members of the Sapindaceae, moved westward. At the same time, three of the four Betula species moved eastward. No clear patterns were observed for the latitudinal shifts among the angiosperms (38 species shifted poleward and 27 shifted southward), whereas the majority of gymnosperms (15 species, or 71.4%) shifted poleward (fig. S7). Fig. 6 Longitudinal species abundance shift mapped on a phylogram representing evolutionary relationships among the 86 study species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DISCUSSION Our results revealed prominent range-wide westward shifts during a short 30-year period, especially for species in low latitudes. The westward shifts are partially associated with the increased moisture availability in the western regions of the study area, coupled with decreased moisture availability in the southeastern regions. Although plants are unlikely to experience precipitation as a direct impact on physiology, they can track changes in water availability through multiple mechanisms, such as their ability to deal with drought, as shown in previous observational studies (3, 22) and modeling simulations (30, 31). The correlation between changes in drought index and species abundance further confirms the importance of moisture availability and/or tolerance, which is also underscored by the fact that the species that shifted significantly westward are those with relatively high drought tolerance. Although the western portion of the study area has increased in moisture availability during the study period, it is still considerably drier compared to the eastern part (fig. S1). However, species with medium and high drought tolerance can take the advantage of the increased moisture availability in the relatively dry region. Future studies using finer measures of physiological traits such as embolism resistance could better address moisture-related mechanisms on species response to climate change. As expected, we also found evidence of poleward shifts in abundance, which is more prominent in high latitudes where substantial warming has occurred during the study period. Our abundance-based poleward shift rate (11.0 km per decade) is similar to a previous estimated rate (10 km per decade) that is based on leading/trailing edges for forests in the eastern United States (23). The fact that the longitudinal shift was 1.4 times faster than latitudinal shift suggests that vegetation dynamics are more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature, at least in a near-term time frame, because moisture availability is considered a critical factor in forest dynamics of eastern North America (32). When considering the predominantly westward and northward shifts of tree species, it is important to understand the geographical settings of the study area, because it has hard boundaries to the east and south (that is, ocean) but soft boundaries to the west and north (that is, climate limitations). Nevertheless, abundance shifts could still be observed even if species ranges are limited by the ocean. It is not surprising that saplings have experienced a higher proportion and faster rate in poleward and westward shifts than adult trees, because new recruitments (that is, young trees) are expected to respond to climate change more quickly (23, 24). The observed differential shift rates could also be due to the fact that saplings are more sensitive to droughts in terms of survival than adult trees (25), as substantial drought was observed in the southeastern region of the study area during the study period. The differential shift rates among subpopulations in the four cardinal quadrants further confirmed that the observed range shift is primarily due to the changes in the leading edges of species distribution ranges, which agreed with early findings by Woodall et al. (23) of significant poleward shifts of seedlings for most of the northern species in the eastern United States. The observed trait- and phylogenetic-specific spatial shift in species’ abundance is fascinating (most angiosperms shifted westward whereas most gymnosperms shifted poleward). There are several mechanisms that could explain these traits and phylogenetic-specific responses. The lack of westward shift in gymnosperms might be partially explained by the fact that gymnosperms have lower maximum growth rates than angiosperms as a result of their less efficient water transport systems (19), making them less competitive in the western portion of the study area, which is drier than the eastern portion (fig. S1). The association between seed size and directional movement of certain species is also interesting and is potentially related to the different colonization, tolerance, and competitive strategies used by different species (33, 34). However, there are large variabilities in seed size among species, and seed size is embedded in a complex of many other traits that together define the life history of a tree species (35). The association between the observed spatial shift and wood density is also an interesting one. Low wood density is often associated with fast growth, whereas high wood density is often associated with high survival (36), which can partially explain the observed southward and westward shift of high wood density species. Because the southern region of the study area experienced droughts and the western part was relatively dry, species with high wood density might have a better chance to survive. The predominantly northward shift of gymnosperm trees, along with all Populus species and most Betula species, is intriguing. The mechanism for the northward shift could potentially be linked to species pollination methods because we found that most wind-pollinated species (most gymnosperms and some angiosperms) shifted northward while animal-pollinated species (most angiosperms) shifted southward. Similar northward shifts of clades were observed in the New England area during the early Holocene (between 10,000 and 8000 years ago), where Picea was replaced by Pinus, followed by Betula and then Quercus species (37). However, the historical process took place over several thousand years, whereas the observed shift in this study happened in a few decades, suggesting the impacts of recent climate change, along with other nonclimatic factors (for example, land use change and forest management), on vegetation dynamics. These trait- and phylogenetic-specific shifts can have profound implications for the resilience and sustainability of the studied forest ecosystems, because phylogenetic relatedness among species can have strong influences on community assemblage and composition (38). Because some closely related species groups (both in functional traits and in evolutionary history) have different responses to the changing climate compared to other groups, the resultant differing spatial shifts among various groups can lead to the possible marked reduction of some evolutionary lineages. The reduction or replacement of certain species in a community can be consequential, because species can have substantially different effects on ecosystem structure, function, and services, and the impacts can cascade through a broad range of ecosystem processes (39, 40). Given the broad scale at which our analysis was conducted, a variety of indirect and nonclimatic factors (for example, fire regimes, invasive species, forest management, conservation efforts, and land use change) could also have influenced the directional trends observed. The fact that the observed abundance change is positively correlated with the densification of forests, which is often attributed to diminishing fire frequency and severity (26), confirms that nonclimatic factors are also responsible for the observed spatial shift of species abundance. Heavy infestations of invasive insects, plants, and pathogens could contribute to species shifts in other directions (41, 42). In addition, forest conservation and plantation efforts in the study area such as those by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program could also influence the observed spatial shift. Nevertheless, we observed clear broad-scale evidence of the impact of climate change on forest tree spatial dynamics, where changes in mean annual precipitation alone explained about 19% of the variability in species abundance change and spatial shift. It could be beneficial for future studies to investigate the impacts of inter- and intra-annual variability of moisture availability at finer spatial and temporal resolutions (for example, for droughts and floods) on vegetation dynamics, given the high likelihood of more variable precipitation patterns in the future (43). In addition, because more repeated plot-level measures are becoming available across the regional scale, we can better study the degree to which climate change induces new community assemblages owing to the varying mortality and recruitment and/or competitive release of different trait- and phylogenetic-specific groups. These repeated measures may eventually enable the analysis of more tree species in the eastern U.S. forests, rather than the selected ones in this study, allowing the detection of phylogenetic- and trait-specific patterns that might be undetected in the current analysis. In summary, trees in the eastern United States have experienced prominent westward and northward shifts in response to climate change and successional processes. These spatial shifts are more sensitive to the changes in moisture availability than to changes in temperature. The observed spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar functional traits and evolutionary histories. The resultant divergent spatial shifts among various groups can have significant ecological consequences and possible extinction of certain evolutionary lineages in some forest communities. Management actions to increase forest ecosystems’ resilience to climate change should consider the changes in both temperature and precipitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained tree abundance data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program from two different inventory periods (Supplementary Text). FIA provides a long-term data set of forest conditions across all forest land in the United States, which has been used to study regional spatial and temporal forest dynamics (23, 24, 44, 45). The first inventory (T1) included in this study was between 1980 and 1995 and varied by state. The second inventory (T2) was the latest completed inventory, which was finished in 2015 for most states. The time period between the two intervals ranged from 20 to 35 years, with an average of 29.5 years (table S4). Across the study area, a total of 201 species/groups were recorded during T1, and 240 were recorded during T2. To account for the variations of sampling protocols between the two inventory periods, we first applied a set of selection criteria (Supplementary Text), which resulted in a total of 86 species/groups in our analysis (table S5). Because a significant portion of the plots were measured during only one of the two inventory periods, we aggregated plot-level abundance data to the hexagon level (a spatial tessellation design used by FIA). A total of 2747 hexagons of 1452 km2 in area, approximately the mean size of eastern counties, were used as the unit of analysis in our study. Total number of stems in a hexagon (stems/ha × total forested area) was used to measure species abundance within each hexagon for saplings [defined as <12.7 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh)] (24), for adult trees (>12.7 cm in dbh), and for all trees by species. To investigate how species abundances shifted between the two inventories, we used the shift distance and direction of the geographic center weighted by species abundance (Supplementary Text). We conducted a total of 10,000 random permutations per species to test whether the observed shift was statistically significant (Supplementary Text). Rose diagrams were generated in the R circular package (46) to illustrate the overall pattern of abundance shift of both direction and distance for all species studied. To understand whether the observed spatial shift is due to the changes in leading or trailing edges, we first subdivided each species distribution range into four cardinal quadrants on the basis of its abundance center at T1. We then calculated and compared the shift distances and density changes for subpopulations within each quadrant. To avoid sampling biases, only species with sufficient sample sizes (≥30 hexagons and ≥300 plots) at either T1 or T2 for each subpopulation were included in this analysis. A Tukey post hoc test was applied to test whether the shifts among subpopulations in each quadrant were statistically different. We then analyzed the relationship between the observed species shifts in relation to climate variables and forest succession status. For climate variables, we first calculated MAT, TAP, and mean PDSI in the recent past (1951–1980) and during the study period (1981–2015). MAT and TAP were calculated using the 4-km spatial resolution climate data from the PRISM Climate Group (http://prism.oregonstate.edu/), and PDSI data were obtained from the WestWide Drought Tracker (www.wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/), which also had a spatial resolution of 4 km. These climate variables were then aggregated at the hexagon level for each period. We used stem density and basal area for all trees regardless of species as indicators of successional status at T1 and T2 for each hexagon. In general, overall stem density decreases whereas basal area increases as forest progresses from early to late successional stages. Next, we calculated relative changes in mean stem density between the two inventories by species, and we calculated relative changes between T1 and T2 in total stem density and basal area for all trees and changes over time in mean MAT, TAP, and PDSI within each species’ overlapped distribution range at T1 and T2 (that is, only with hexagons that contain the target species at both T1 and T2). A multiple linear regression with a mixed-effects model was performed to test the association among changes in species-level mean stem density and changes in MAT, TAP, PDSI, total stem density, and total basal area. To test whether the observed spatial shifts are trait-specific, we first constructed a database with two functional trait groups (table S3). The first group encompassed traits associated with trees’ ability to migrate, including seed weight, dispersal mechanism, and rate of spread. The second group encompassed traits associated with trees’ physiological tolerances, including temperature, precipitation, fire, shade, and drought tolerances. Because of the lack of actual precipitation and temperature tolerance data, we used minimum temperature, minimum precipitation, and maximum precipitation from species-specific realized climatic niche as surrogates in our study (see table S3 for variable definition and data sources). We compared species traits among four classes: significant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant east or southward shift, and significant eastward or southward shift. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used for traits with continuous variables, and a χ2 test was used for traits with categorical variables due to the non-normality of the data. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis test for differences in latitudinal and longitudinal shift rates was used for categorical plant traits. We investigated the degree to which longitudinal and latitudinal shifts were associated with the evolutionary relatedness of tree species by displaying these shifts on a phylogenetic supertree encompassing the 86 species in the study and by testing for phylogenetic signal in these shifts. The phylogenetic supertree was pruned from one generated for 397 native tree species occurring throughout the forests of the contiguous 48 states and inventoried by FIA, as described by Potter and Woodall (47). We used the R package phytools (48) to display each species’ longitudinal and latitudinal shifts (across all life stages) on the phylogenetic tree, with trees in the aforementioned four classes. We then used the R package picante (49) to test the degree to which the tree species phylogeny predicts the ecological similarity of the species with respect to these shifts. Specifically, we generated the K statistic, which compares the observed phylogenetic signal in a trait (in this case, the longitudinal or latitudinal shift) to the signal under a Brownian motion model of trait evolution on a phylogeny (50), and then assessed the statistical significance of the phylogenetic signal by comparing observed patterns of the variance of independent contrasts of each trait to a null model of shuffled taxon labels across the tips of the phylogeny.

But the team has a hypothesis: While climate change has elevated temperatures across the eastern United States, it has significantly altered rainfall totals. The northeast has gotten a little more rain since 1980 than it did during the proceeding century, while the southeast has gotten much less rain. The Great Plains, especially in Oklahoma and Kansas, get much more than historically normal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Different species are responding to climate change differently. Most of the broad-leaf species—deciduous trees—are following moisture moving westward. The evergreen trees—the needle species—are primarily moving northward,” said Songlin Fei, a professor of forestry at Purdue University and one of the authors of the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are a patchwork of other forces which could cause tree populations to shift west, though. Changes in land use, wildfire frequency, and the arrival of pests and blights could be shifting the population. So might the success of conservation efforts. But Fei and his colleagues argue that at least 20 percent of the change in population area is driven by changes in precipitation, which are heavily influenced by human-caused climate change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a very cool study, with results that seem to raise more questions than they can provide answers for,” said Loïc D’Orangeville, an ecologist at the Quebec Forest Research Center who was not connected to the study, in an email. “West is usually drier in the study region, so although it’s been wetter in the recent decades, it’s still drier than the East.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I can’t really make up [for] that moisture attractiveness for trees,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movement of conifers and other needle trees north makes much more sense. Conifers are already more vulnerable to temperature than flowering, deciduous trees. They also already populate the boreal forest of eastern North America, so they’re well-adapted to the colder, drier conditions they will find as they expand north in the United States.

It examines not only the majestic, landmark tracts of untrammeled forest (like George Washington National Forest) but the humbler woods, as well: stands of trees near the highway, at the edge of housing developments, and in the middle of city parks."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three years of court dates and doctors’ reports sustained by anguished memories of 2-year-old Amara’s joyful, outgoing spirit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday finally brought the justice Ou sought with a life prison sentence handed down against Syna Lim, herself a mother of two children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I have relief the court part’s over,” Ou told the Times-Union afterward. “I’m very pleased.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury convicted Lim, 41, of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse last month in the October 2006 beating death of the St. Johns County girl. She died of severe head trauma three days after being rushed from Lim’s home to Wolfson Children’s Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the only possible sentence was life in prison, dozens of Lim’s friends and relatives — some traveling from as far as Canada — packed the courtroom to support her. None chose to speak, said Lim’s attorney, Chief Assistant Public Defender Refik Eler. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amara’s parents also declined to testify, but issued a statement to the court through Assistant State Attorney Sam Garrison. He said the loss of their daughter was made more difficult because it came at the hands of someone they trusted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They will never get over this loss,” Garrison told Circuit Judge Mallory Cooper. “All the defendant had to say was she didn’t want to watch her, and this never would have happened.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ou said later that Amara was a friendly child who would smile and wave at everyone she saw when her parents took her out. He praised police and prosecutors for sticking with the case and ensuring justice for his daughter.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week Circuit Judge Angela Cox ordered a new trial for Syna Lim, 48, who was convicted in 2009 for the murder of Amara Ou. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lim will now get a new trial if outgoing State Attorney Angela Corey and State Attorney-elect Melissa Nelson choose to retry her. Prosecutors also could choose to drop the case and let Lim go free, or Cox’s ruling could be sent to the 1st District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have advised the victim’s family of Judge Cox’s decision,” said Corey spokeswoman Jackelyn Barnard. “We are currently reviewing the order and we will be deciding in the near future whether we will appeal Judge Cox’s order or proceed to a second trial.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nelson will replace Corey the first week of January after defeating the incumbent in the Aug. 30 election. She has previously told the Times-Union she will not comment on any pending cases before taking office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a new trial could raise troubling questions about former Chief Medical Examiner Margarita Arruza, who conducted the original autopsy on Amara and did not find she was suffering from diabetes. Aruzza resigned several years later, and allegations have surfaced that she suffered from the early effects of Alzheimer’s disease while still serving as medical examiner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The toddler’s father left her in Lim’s care at the woman’s Jacksonville residence at 6305 Devonhurst Drive in 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lim later told police the child wouldn’t wake up from a nap a few hours later, so for two hours she tried calling the mother before reaching the father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors said the 2-year-old was brain dead upon arrival at the hospital and had bruises on her head and limbs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lim told police she was doing laundry, and Amara must have fallen off the couch. Prosecutors charged Lim with first-degree murder and child abuse and said she hit Amara with the handle of a flyswatter and then delivered a crushing blow to the child’s skull. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chief Assistant Public Defender Refik Eler and Assistant Public Defender Michelle Barki did not dispute that Ou had died from blunt head force trauma at the original trial but contended it wasn’t Lim who did it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Once blunt force trauma became accepted by all parties as the child’s cause of death, with no suggested alternate cause of death, the defendant was doomed,” wrote Lim’s current attorney, Samuel Jacobson, in court filings arguing that she deserved a new trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eler has been found to be ineffective in criminal cases four times in recent years, but Cox did not find him deficient in this case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lim was convicted and Circuit Judge Mallory Cooper sentenced her to life in prison for the murder and an additional 30 years for child abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But according to court records, years after the conviction an Orlando pathologist and a Jacksonville pediatrician re-examined the case and determined that Amara did not die from blunt force trauma at all. They testified that Amara had been suffering from diabetes and a condition called “disseminated intravascular coagulation,” or DIC, that produces uncontrolled internal bleeding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Uncontrolled bleeding from DIC, the physicians testified, likely caused the bruising and other discolorations on or about the child which were interpreted by the treating personnel as indications of trauma,” Jacobson said in court filings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words, the medical evidence suggests Amara may have died from internal bleeding and was never the victim of blunt force trauma, Jacobson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said their motions to dismiss did not involve the competence of Aruzza since the focus of their argument was that this was new evidence that justified a new trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mrs. Lim’s new evidence is her most important evidence,” Jacobson said. “With it her innocence is realistically demonstrable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if prosecutors choose to go back to court, Jacobson said he intended to challenge the original autopsy and raise the issue of Aruzza’s competence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Orlando pathologist questioned the competence and soundness of mind of the person who did the original autopsy, Jacobson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barnard said it would be inappropriate to comment on a potential second trial. Corey defended Aruzza this year after questions were raised, saying all of the cases where she performed the autopsie were re-examined by her successor Valerie Rao, or someone else in the Medical Examiner’s Office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other medical examiners then testified when those cases went to trial based on their own independent examinations of the evidence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A judge overturned the conviction of Syna Lim, who was found guilty of killing Amara Ou. According to court documents, there is newly discovered evidence as to the cause of the toddler's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the October 2009 trial, prosecutors contended Lim beat the St. Augustine girl with the handle of a flyswatter, then struck the child's head with a hard object. A jury found Lim guilty of first-degree murder and she was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Deborah Thoni told the appeals court that the toddler had a “classical” case of diabetic ketoacidosis, which led to her death, not blunt-force trauma to the head, which was the cause of death determined at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Aylin Ozdemir also told the court that medical testing done prior to Amara’s death was inadequate, especially because there was no urinalysis done before the child went into the emergency room. Post-mortem testing showed the girl had extremely high glucose levels. Ozdemir said the condition causes uncontrolled bleeding that causes internal and external bruising that could be mistaken for trauma. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lim, now 48 years old, appealed on two claims, the new evidence and ineffective counsel. She has since withdrawn the claim of ineffective counsel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have advised the victim’s family of Judge Cox’s decision,\" the State Attorney's Office said. \"We are currently reviewing the order and we will be deciding in the near future whether we will appeal Judge Cox’s order or proceed to a second trial.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Copyright 2016 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judges were impressed by the house’s fine craftsmanship, attention to detail (especially the peppermint columns, the gumdrop crenellations, and the chandelier in the back) and great sense of humor. Anjulie remarked: “Love the inclusion of the nuclear family.” What really had us in stitches was Sydney’s wonderfully rich description, especially this part: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “…You’ll know you’re living in the lap of luxury when you see the ENORMOUS GOLD CHANDELIER in the dining room. But it’s the ROOFTOP PATIO with no discernible purpose or point of entry that will really set you apart from your neighbors. “Hey, how did you get up there?” they’ll ask, but you’re not telling (mysterious!). The landscaping will make you feel like you’re in the countryside, in a sea of royal icing TURF GRASS (shown here, lightly dusted with coconut snow). The FOUR TREES on the property are either too far from the house to provide any shade (stately!) or extremely close to the house and actively obscuring at least one window (posh!). The entire house, the front walk, and the driveway are all bordered in royal icing ENGLISH IVY, which is definitely never going to be a problem for native plants (colonial!).” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Honorable Mention #3: Suburban Hobbit House by Jennifer K. & Cara M.

Windows glazing is made of gelatine sheets coated with black-coloured blueberry jam to ensure privacy as you lounge by the bay window or enjoy the views from the beautiful faux-balcony. All doors are solid gum paste, with royal icing on all window frames as well as the balustrade. This home is ideal for entertaining, with its luxurious two-story entrance featuring genuine Spanish _neula_ columns with doric capitals, ornated pediment and a quaint half-tindered wall that gives true European _charme_. Utilities are housed in a lovely turret next to the service door. The garage accomodates two SUVs or six European sedan cars. The magnificent brown-sugar-paved front yard features icing plants and a signature landscaped crushed-sprinkle turf patch on cookie soil.

Without further ado: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keep reading ||||| When Dr. Kishin Ramani decided to sell his six-bedroom, Georgian-style home on a half-acre lot in Hinsdale three years ago, it never occurred to him that he'd be resigned to accepting far less than he paid when he bought the home in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramani was immediately drawn to the home, built in 2003, because \"it was gorgeous and airy, with the highest ceilings I'd seen.\" A recent appraisal said it is worth $2.5 million. But after years on the market, and dropping the price three times to $1.99 million, he says he is ready to take a $600,000 loss on the home because he has little choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He needs to move soon into a new home he had built in Oak Brook for his wife, Dr. Suman Kaur, his two children and his parents, and he has no interest in keeping two homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, as he digests the loss he must take, he notices other homeowners nearby going through the same shock with homes known as McMansions. One neighbor recently marked his home down $750,000 to $1.95 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is nothing in the overall housing data that says the housing market is this bad,\" said Ramani's real estate agent, Linda Feinstein of Re/Max Signature Homes. But while smaller, lower-priced homes have often recovered significantly from the housing crash that started in 2007, McMansions are slower to come back, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The McMansion style, built between 2001 and 2007 and averaging 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, lacks the appeal with today's buyers compared to old vintage homes or large freshly built homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The McMansion style, built between 2001 and 2007 and averaging 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, lacks appeal with today's buyers compared with old vintage homes or large freshly built homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The realization is especially hard on homeowners trying to sell because when they bought the giant homes in the early 2000s, they thought of them as great investments, Feinstein said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, the idea was that bigger was better because prices presumably would keep going up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, housing analysts say the day of the McMansion has come and gone. An analysis just completed by Trulia shows that the amount buyers are willing to pay for McMansions over other homes has fallen 26 percent in just four years. As homes in general have been regaining value, McMansions have been losing appeal in comparison to others as the giants of the pre-crash years have aged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trend in the Chicago area has been similar to the national averages. Trulia economist Ralph McLaughlin notes that just four years ago, when most McMansions weren't yet 10 years old, people were willing to pay a higher premium to get the large houses than they are willing to pay now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This year in Chicago, buyers have been willing to pay only a 118.9 percent premium for a McMansion compared with what they will pay for a non-McMansion. In other words, McMansions, which should be more expensive because they are large, are selling for slightly more than two times the average non-McMansion. But in 2012, people were willing to spend far more for McMansions. Then, the premium was 145.5 percent over the typical non-McMansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nationally, the premiums have dropped from 138 percent in 2012 to 117 percent recently. The declines have been extreme in some Florida markets, where premiums have plunged more than 80 percent in areas such as Fort Lauderdale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The median price of a McMansion in the Chicago area was $598,000 in 2007, McLaughlin said. This year, it has been $485,000. The median price of non-McMansions has been $222,000, according to Trulia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As McMansions were being built in the early 2000s, some observers questioned whether the homes — named after the generic, mass-produced approach of fast food — would remain desirable. They were criticized for being ostentatious and cheaply built. They were often stuffed onto suburban lots that seemed too small, where the main structure appeared to be dominated by the three-car garage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Targeted at Generation X in their homebuying prime as they raised families, many of the buyers in their 30s and early 40s lost the homes in foreclosure as values plunged. Now, McLaughlin said, there are few buyers for the pricey homes in part because of a change in demographics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gen Xers have been scarred psychologically and financially from the crash in their home values, short sales and foreclosures, he said. With tarnished credit scores, many who lost homes can't afford to buy again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, millennials are not marrying and having families at the rate of previous generations, loans are tough to get, and renting in cities is more popular with single affluent 20-somethings than buying large suburban homes. Baby boomers tend to downsize rather than replace family homes with McMansions, McLaughlin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, people seeking size want homes that are built new rather than the dated McMansions that appealed to early 2000s tastes, said Tim Schiller, an @properties real estate agent who sells in Elmhurst. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People 35 to 45 with two careers and 1.2 kids want bigger, bigger, bigger,\" he said. \"But they want dark floors, gray walls and white kitchen cabinets,\" which are in contrast to the McMansion style. For clients trying to sell McMansions, he tries to persuade them first to redo the floors and cabinets as well as the paint. Then, he said, they sell at higher prices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such an overhaul, however, can approach $100,000. And redoing floors is hard to do when people live in the homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's tough for a person to stomach making such expensive changes when they still appear new, Feinstein said. \"A lot have beautiful cherry floors that were in vogue when built, but buyers now want floors darker or a rich brown.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Generally, buyers will pay 20 percent more for a new home than an older home, even when the older home is just five to 10 years old, McLaughlin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It isn't just McMansions that are getting snubbed by homebuyers now. While low-priced homes are in demand and in short supply on the market, luxury homes built years before McMansions also are selling slowly, and sellers are being forced to cut their asking prices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Chicago area, Re/Max research found that for homes and condos on the market for more than $1 million, prices dropped 9 percent during the first three months of this year. The homes were not moving quickly despite brisk sales in the $200,000 to $300,000 range. Sellers had them on the market on average 155 days before arriving at a deal with a buyer. Last year it took 118 days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR gmarksjarvis@chicagotribune.com NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter @gailmarksjarvis ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the late 1990s, Americans started referring to tract-built luxury homes popping up in the suburbs as McMansions, a biting portmanteau implying that the structures were mass-produced and ugly. There was also the implied snark that their denizens, however wealthy, lacked the sophistication to tell filet mignon from a Big Mac. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lately, these homes have been the subject of fresh scorn, thanks to an anonymously authored blog that breaks down the genre’s design flaws in excruciating detail. Posts lambasted builders for erecting garages bigger than the homes they’re attached to, dropping giant houses on tiny lots, plus shoddy construction and a mishmash of contrasting styles. (Gothic Tudor, anyone?) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s fun reading that nevertheless raised the question: How well have these homes kept their value? Not well, compared with the rest of the U.S. housing market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The premium that buyers can expect to pay for a McMansion in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., declined by 84 percent from 2012 to 2016, according to data compiled by Trulia. In Las Vegas, the premium dropped by 46 percent and in Phoenix, by 42 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Real estate agents don’t usually tag their listings #McMansion, so to compile the data, Trulia created a proxy, measuring the price appreciation of homes built from 2001 and 2007 that have 3,000 to 5,000 square feet. While there’s no single size designation, and plenty of McMansions were built outside that time window, those specifications capture homes built at the height of the trend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McMansions cost more to build than your average starter ranch home does, and they will sell for more. But the return on investment has dropped like a stone. The additional cash that buyers should be willing to part with to get a McMansion fell in 85 of the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. For example, four years ago a typical McMansion in Fort Lauderdale was valued at $477,000, a 274 percent premium over all other homes in the area. This year, those McMansions are worth about $611,000, or 190 percent more than the rest the homes on the market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The few areas in which McMansions are gaining value faster than more tasteful housing stock are located primarily in the Midwest and the eastern New York suburbs that make up Long Island. The McMansion premium in Long Island has increased by 10 percent over the last four years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility is that builders have spent the last five years flooding housing markets with a new wave of large homes, bringing prices down. The median size of new homes dipped from 2007 through 2009, but then started climbing again—reaching a high of 2,488 square feet in the third quarter of last year. All those new, big homes may have watered down demand for older, big homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along the same lines, builders have largely neglected the market for smaller, entry-level homes since the housing market collapsed nine years ago, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Trulia. That’s created excess demand for smaller, older abodes, leading those homes to appreciate faster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there's another possibility: McMansion owners are losing out because the market considers their homes an ugly investment, too."}

He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in the fall of 2016 and underwent treatment. Bradley headed out on the road earlier this year after receiving a clean bill of health but the cancer recently returned, spreading to his liver.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley's reps added, \"Thank you for your prayers during this difficult time. Mr. Bradley was truly grateful for all the love he’s received from his fans and we hope his message of love is remembered and carried on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The world lost a ton of heart today,\" Gabriel Roth, co-founder of Bradley's label Daptone Records, said. \"Charles was somehow one of the meekest and strongest people I've ever known. His pain was a cry for universal love and humanity. His soulful moans and screams will echo forever on records and in the ears and hearts of those who were fortunate enough to share time with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I find some solace knowing that he will continue to inspire love and music in this world for generations to come,\" he added. \"I told him as much a few days ago. He smiled and told me, 'I tried.' It was probably the simplest and most inspiring thing he ever told me. I think he wanted to hug each person on this planet individually. I mean that literally, and anyone that ever saw him knows that he honestly tried.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"RIP to our dear brother Charles Bradley,\" veteran Afrobeat group and Daptone Records labelmate Antibalas wrote on Twitter. \"Your heart was too big for this planet. See you on the other side. We love you.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the course of three albums – 2011's No Time for Dreaming, 2013's Victim of Love and 2016's Changes – Bradley, known as the \"Screaming Eagle of Soul,\" blended heartfelt ballads of love, longing and remorse with raucous tracks celebrating joy and the survival of a hardscrabble life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles Edward Bradley was born November 5th, 1948 in Florida but his mother, who had left for New York, moved Bradley to Brooklyn when he was 8 years old. At 14, Bradley left home and became homeless, sleeping on New York subway trains for warmth. \"I was afraid that she was going to hurt me, so I left,\" Bradley said of his mother in the 2012 documentary Charles Bradley: Soul of America. \"We couldn't see eye to eye and I was getting blamed for everything, so I was very bitter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1962, Bradley's sister took him to James Brown's landmark performance at the Apollo Theater when he was 14. The show transformed Bradley, who would later find regional success in New York as a James Brown impersonator named Black Velvet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was breathtaking,\" Bradley told Rolling Stone of the Apollo show in 2016. \"I didn't know who James Brown really was but I wanted to go see. When they called James Brown onstage, I'll never forget they had this purple light and yellow light – my two favorite colors. And when they introduced him, he came flying on the stage on one leg and I said, 'What in the hell is this?' [Laughs] And I was mesmerized. I was just gone. I was just shocked. Shocked. I said, 'Wow. I wanna be something like that.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fledgling impersonator went home, attached string to a broom to emulate Brown's bombastic mic swings, and began impersonating the singer in private before performing his first show as Brown at age 19 in 1967. \"I was really scared to do it, so they snuck a bottle of gin [laughs] in the gym with 7-Up in it, and I got fired up,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"I said, 'Give me that mic!' ... I ain't never stopped yet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A drifter as a teen who battled with illiteracy, poverty and chronic unemployment, the Brooklyn singer would later nearly die from a penicillin allergy and find his brother murdered by Bradley's own nephew. Bradley became an itinerant after leaving home, traveling across the country in 1977 after spending 10 years as a cook at a Maine hospital for the mentally ill before ending up in California. Shows would come occasionally, but Bradley was unable to find any success in music at the time. After getting laid off from his job after 17 years in 1994, Bradley reconnected with his estranged mother Inez, moving back to Brooklyn to take care of her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, Bradley nearly died from an allergy. \"I was sick as a dog,\" he said in Soul of America. \"I was close to death. I'm allergic to penicillin and they was feeding me penicillin and my body had shut down.\" After recovering, his brother Joseph told him, \"Now do something that you want to do. Follow your dreams. You love music. Do it.\" As documented in Soul of America, the singer was a functional illiterate, able to read at a first-grade level and seeing a tutor weekly to improve his reading skills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after his hospitalization, Bradley endured one of the biggest tragedies of his life when his older brother Joseph was robbed and murdered by one of Bradley's nephews. \"I stopped dead; I blocked it out of my head,\" Bradley told Okayplayer in 2011. \"I said 'Lord, please don’t let it be true.' ... I went down screaming.\" Bradley detailed the event in 2011's \"Heartaches and Pain,\" singing, \"I woke up this morning/My momma she was cryin/So i looked out my window/Police lights was flashing/People was screaming/So i ran down to the street/My friends grabbed my shoulder/And he said these words to me: Life is full of sorrow.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With his brother's call to \"follow his dreams\" echoing in his head, Bradley eked out a living in New York clubs covering Brown, incorporating wigs and costumes he would hand-sew himself. (During the day, Bradley worked as a handyman to make ends meet.) Roth saw one of Bradley's shows and introduced him to label producer-musician Tom Brenneck, who would go on to produce all three Bradley albums. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'll carry that man in my heart for the rest of my life,\" Brenneck said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, at the age of 62, Bradley released his debut album No Time for Dreaming with the Menahan Street Band after a string of singles. The album, which included the galvanizing \"The World (Is Going Up in Flames),\" was named by Rolling Stone as one of the 50 Best Albums of the Year. \"Don’t tell me how to live my life / When you never felt the pain,\" Bradley sings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I been struggling for over 42 years trying to make it in the industry,\" he said in Soul of America. \"And at the age of 62, I'm just beginning to find my way through. I never made enough money to support myself in music, but I'm hoping that this album will make a turning point for me ... I ask myself why it took so long, but you can't question God when he want to do things.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Victim of Love, with its unlikely hit \"Strictly Reserved for You,\" would follow in 2013, earning near-universal critical acclaim and bolstering Bradley's status as a soul star with unmatched authenticity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley's final album, Changes, arrived in 2016, taking its title from a cover on the album of Black Sabbath's 1972 ballad. Bradley hadn't heard of the heavy metal pioneers, but connected with Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler's personal lyrics about transformation as Bradley watched his mom's health deteriorate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The verse that really stuck to me was, 'It took so long to realize/That I can still hear her last goodbyes/Now all my days are filled with tears/Wish I could go back and change these years,'\" Bradley told Rolling Stone. \"Because it was like my mom saying she was sick and she was leaving me and something about that song … I just took the last lyrics and wow. So I got stuck on it. I didn't really have to 'learn' it; it just stuck to my brain.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The minimalist video, shot shortly after Bradley's mom's death, consists solely of a close-up one-shot of the singer at his most vulnerable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As fiery and poignant as Bradley could be on record, his live shows allowed the singer to both channel his decades of adoration for Brown alongside his own boisterous flourishes. Like labelmate Sharon Jones, a Charles Bradley show balanced the flamboyant with the crestfallen, alternating between elated party and a singer's catharsis laid bare in public. Bradley was a relentlessly transfixing presence onstage, able to quiet an entire audience with a ballad before turning a crowd frenzied with full-stage dancing and a deep, full-throated roar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in his stomach, forcing Bradley to cancel his fall tour. \"I will fight through this like I've fought through the many other obstacles in my life,\" Bradley said at the time. \"Music is how I share my love with the world, and the love that my fans have given back brings me so much joy.\" Earlier this month, the cancer metastasized to his liver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I love all of you out there that made my dreams come true,\" Bradley said earlier this month. \"When I come back, I'll come back strong, with God's love. With God's will, I'll be back soon.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Right now, I don't see a stopping point 'cause I don't see no place where I can stop at and rest in peace,\" he told Rolling Stone last year. \"But I know that from doing shows for the public, the love when I go out into the audience and hug 'em and the things that they say to me personally … [pauses] Wow. It's not only me onstage doing it. I open their hearts up and they feel the love of my heart and when I go out there and really respond to 'em and talk to 'em, they tell me some things.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toward the end of Soul of America, Bradley cried when discussing his place in the world. \"Sometimes I say, 'God, just call me home.' Because every day I get out and I fight and fight the keep the honesty [and] the decency of a human being walking the planet and loving everybody as God asked you to love everybody,\" Bradley said. \"How much more can one give before they find love on the planet? I say, 'Father, when the time of the hour you want me, I'm ready to go.' And before I leave this world, I say, 'Let the world know they can't change me ... I love everybody. I never do nobody no harm.'\""}

{"context": "STAGECRAFT A coin toss determines speaking order: Mr. Obama opens and Mr. Romney closes. Their respective campaign representatives have spent days on details as small as how many family members can take the stage after the debate, a sign that almost nothing will be left to chance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet the chemistry between the two candidates cannot be rehearsed and their interactions could be just as important as the answers to the debate questions. Mr. Romney has practiced being “respectfully aggressive,” a senior adviser said, with a goal of pleasing Republicans who believe he has been too passive. At the same time, the objective is to not turn off independent voters, women or others who may be disappointed with Mr. Obama’s policies but still like him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Romney’s goal is not focused on tearing down the president, aides said, but rather to use the audience of tens of millions of Americans to show that he can be trusted to improve their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In my view it’s not so much winning and losing — it’s about something bigger than that,” Mr. Romney told supporters here Monday night. “These debates are an opportunity for each of us to describe a pathway forward.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president, who polls show has developed a lead in several battleground states, has been instructed by aides to use humor and his wide smile to fend off attempts to be drawn into the fray. He is aiming to be confident and humble about his first term, one adviser said, in hopes of avoiding coming across as “arrogant or dismissive.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both candidates will come to the debate armed with well-practiced one-liners, the moments they hope will become sound bites that will shape the narrative in the days to come. It will be telling how long they wait before starting to unload them and how they address one another from the outset of the debate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OLD VS. NEW The general election debates, which pushed presidential campaigns into the television age a half-century ago, are now facing a new test. The rise of social media has already reshaped the race, raising questions of whether the audience will match the 52.8 million viewers who tuned into the first debate between Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain four years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But this year, on the eve of the first debate, Ohio became the second battleground state on Tuesday to open its doors to early voting. And by the time the third debate takes place on Oct. 22, tens of millions of Americans will have already voted. ||||| After weeks of anticipatory news coverage, breathless spin and counter-spin from both sides aiming to lower expectations for their own guy, and occasional off-cue moments from surrogates, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will take the stage in Denver today for the first of three debates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With polls showing Obama with a slight lead nationally, and a bigger lead in swing states, Romney needs to deliver tonight and score something of a win if he wants to change the race’s arc. That’s not to say it will be the GOP nominee’s only chance to shine, but it will be an important one. For Romney, tonight is the chance to let viewers see him differently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Tonight's debate: What not to do NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (See also: Complete coverage of the Colorado presidential debate) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Below, POLITICO’s five things to watch for: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Can Romney win the first half-hour? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was the strong, aggressive Romney that chewed up and spat out Newt Gingrich at the moments he most needed a game-changer in the Republican primaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was the churlish Romney who bet Rick Perry $10,000. And there was also the rules-abiding Romney, who called for help from moderator Anderson Cooper when Perry ate up too much time in one of the face-offs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney is getting conflicting advice on which debate personality should show up. He has twice debated a Democrat one on one — Ted Kennedy in 1994, where the results were not great, and with Shannon O’Brien, where a good debate showing helped him become Massachusetts governor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney’s got a difficult task, which is to be aggressive without attacking the president, who has high personal approval ratings too fiercely. He has to seem tough but also presidential, assertive but not snide. He has to accuse Obama of not being honest with voters, without sounding shrill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winning over voters in a popularity contest is never going to be easy for the GOP nominee, but if he can demonstrate the ability to be president — to convince voters it’s a role he can play, and seem serious and substantive — he will go a ways toward his goal of changing the race’s current arc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tonight will go the furthest toward showing whether Romney recognizes the race is in its final stages, and that either political victory or political death is nigh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Obama, Romney can seem smug and prickly when challenged. He needs to go in relaxed, without memorizing his briefing book to the point of paralysis. Romney will try to trip up the president, but he needs to be as nimble as possible. Also like Obama, Romney is a good but not expert debater. He can make a mistake in a weak or unpredictable moment. And the fact that he started laying out a few new policy statements 48 hours before the debate suggests he knows tough questions are coming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: Mitt, be nimble) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first half hour of a presidential debate tends to be when the tone is set. Romney needs to score points, quick and early. The good news for Romney is that reporters love a comeback story, which is only bolstering his chances of decent coverage the next day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. How hard will Obama attack? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president does not tend to fare as well going negative. But he has to attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fact one: Obama’s surge against Romney was powered by a relentless, pounding summertime assault — led by surrogates and staff for the most part — on his challenger’s fitness to lead and capacity to comprehend the struggles of regular working people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fact Two: Obama’s surge was also fueled by a huge lead over Romney on personal approval — and that edge could disappear if he appears too negative tonight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reconciling those two realities — how to seem civil while trashing Romney to his face — is probably the biggest challenge facing the incumbent Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: 10 great debate moments) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's genius in 2008 was his ability to slam his opponents and their top surrogates through the use of code words, casting John McCain and Bill Clinton as icons of a bygone era, who needed to be dispatched into dignified retirement. But this is a different election — and incumbents, especially ones with as little margin for error as Obama — can’t afford to be subtle. ||||| Conventional wisdom holds that the first presidential debate offers an especially good opportunity for the challenging candidate, who for the first time gets to stand on a literal public stage, and a proverbial level playing field, with the incumbent president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As much as we like to debunk the conventional wisdom at FiveThirtyEight, this hypothesis has the ring of empirical truth to it. There are no guarantees for Mitt Romney, and if he makes gains in the polls following Wednesday night’s debate in Denver, they will probably be fairly modest. But if historical precedent is any guide, he is more likely than not to see his standing improve at least some. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This analysis will be quite simple: I’ve made a comparison of the polls just before and just after the presidential debate in years dating back to 1976. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The polls in the “before” row consist of a simple average of all polls that ended their interviewing within a week before the first debate. The polls in the “after” row consist of those that began their interviewing in the week that followed it. Polls that overlapped with the debate are excluded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the table that follows, I’ve viewed the impact of the debate from the standpoint of the incumbent-party and challenging-party candidates. I make no distinction based on whether the incumbent-party candidate was literally the incumbent president, or instead just the standard-bearer for his party. But in all years in this analysis except for 2008, the incumbent-party candidate was the current vice president if he was not the current president, which may put some of the same dynamics into play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a lot of detail in the table, but let me give you the numbers and then we can describe some of the more interesting bits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first thing to notice is that the debates normally have a modest impact. The largest shift in the before-and-after numbers during this period came in 1984, when Walter Mondale gained a net of 3.6 percentage points on Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately for Mr. Mondale, he still trailed Mr. Reagan by 17 points, which was close to the margin he lost by on Election Day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several other debates produced a shift in the three-point range in one direction or another, and the average shift was 2.3 percentage points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Second, there were two debates that reversed the leader in the race. Mr. Reagan, in 1980, moved ahead of Jimmy Carter following their first and only head-to-head debate on Oct. 28, and then he won overwhelmingly. In 2000, George W. Bush moved ahead of Al Gore in the polls after their first debate, and Mr. Bush won the election, although he lost the popular vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The third conclusion follows from this: The candidate ahead in the polls after the first debate always won the Electoral College during this period. I wouldn’t make too much of this: it’s not like Mr. Romney is going to be out of the running if he trails Barack Obama by one point in the polls a week from now. But it’s really getting quite late in the game once the first debate is held — so it will be one of his best, and last, opportunities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fourth — and I’ve already given away the cliffhanger — the first debate has normally helped the challenger. In the nine elections between 1976 and 2008, there were only two years when the incumbent-party candidate gained ground relative to the challenger; these cases were 1976, when Gerald R. Ford halved his six-point deficit with Jimmy Carter, and 1988, when George H.W. Bush moved just slightly further ahead of Michael Dukakis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on average, the challenging-party candidate gained a net of one and a half percentage points on the incumbent-party candidate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the challenger’s gains have come mainly from undecided voters rather than from the incumbent himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you look at the poll average for the incumbent and challenging candidates individually, the incumbent candidate held steady on average at 45.5 percent of the vote both before and after the debate. However, the challenger improved to 43.9 percent of the vote from 42.4 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So a reasonable best guess, based on the historical precedent and without considering any factors specific to this race, is that Mr. Romney will gain a point or two in the polls by next week, while Mr. Obama’s number will hold steady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have been several years, particularly 1992 and 2000, when the incumbent-party candidate lost vote share, but this is balanced out by others in which the candidate made gains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tendency for the challenger’s numbers to improve has been more robust, however. The only year in which the challenger lost a material amount of ground was in 1992, an unusual case in which both Mr. Bush and Bill Clinton lost ground relative to H. Ross Perot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But here’s the bad news for Mr. Romney: no candidate who trailed by as much he did heading into the first debate went on to win the election. In the two cases where the lead reversed after the debate, 1980 and 2000, the trailing candidate was down only one or two points in the polls. The FiveThirtyEight “now-cast,” conversely, pegs Mr. Romney’s deficit at about 5 points instead. (Other methods put it at between three and four points.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More bad news for Mr. Romney: although there has been a tendency for the challenging candidate to gain ground immediately after the first debate, there has not been any tendency for the challenger to gain over the remaining weeks of the election. On average during these years, the challenging candidate trailed by 1.5 percentage points in polls conducted just after the first debate — and the challenger eventually lost the election, on average, by 1.4 percentage points, a nearly identical margin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of these conclusions are based on a small sample size, and so they ought to be interpreted with some caution. But two basic and common-sensical ideas ought to hold. First, the debate is an excellent opportunity for Mr. Romney: probably not to draw the race into a tie or take the lead, but at least to narrow his deficit. Second, if Mr. Romney does not take advantage of it, he will be in some trouble. ||||| President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney come face to face for the first time in this presidential campaign Wednesday night for a nationally televised debate that will give millions of Americans a chance to size up two fierce competitors in a moment of high-risk theater.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney poses for a photo with workers as he makes an unscheduled stop at a Chipotle restaurant in Denver, Tuesday, Oct. 2, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney, trailing in polls in a number of key states and running short on time to reverse his fortunes, is angling for a breakout performance in the three 90-minute presidential debates scheduled over the next three weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama, well aware that the remaining five weeks of the race still offer enough time for tectonic shifts in his prospects, is determined to avoid any campaign-altering mistakes as he presses his case for a second term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pre-debate skirmish Tuesday over Vice President Joe Biden's passing reference to \"a middle class that has been buried the last four years\" demonstrated how just a few words can mushroom into something larger during a heated contest for the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's 9 p.m. EDT faceoff between Obama and Romney on domestic policy at the University of Denver is sure to offer a blend of choreography and spontaneity: Both men have spent hours rehearsing smart lines and pithy comebacks with proxy opponents _ yet know to expect the unexpected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's what so tricky about this,\" says Alan Schroeder, author of a book on presidential debates. \"There's never a template for preparing because each one takes its own direction.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The central role of the economy in this election is evident in the topics selected for the first three of the night's six debate segments: The Economy I, The Economy II and The Economy III. The last three segments will focus on health care, the role of government and governing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney has pinned his campaign on the argument that Obama has failed to adequately juice up the U.S. economy, but his challenge is reflected in recent polls showing growing public optimism about the economy and the president's leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans tried to frame the economic debate in their terms Tuesday by pointing to the vice president's comments in North Carolina about the beleaguered middle class as an unwitting acknowledgement that Obama's economic policies have devastated average Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We agree,\" GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan declared in Iowa. \"That means we need to stop digging by electing Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's camp countered that it was the policies of the president's Republican predecessors that had caused the damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Biden, at a later campaign event, was careful to say that \"the middle class was buried by the policies that Romney and Ryan supported,\" calling their economic plans an amped-up rework of those from the George W. Bush years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney calls Wednesday's debate the beginning of a monthlong \"conversation with the American people,\" and the debates do tend to consume much of the political oxygen for several crucial weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The candidates will be speaking to a TV audience of tens of millions in one of those rare moments when a critical mass of Americans collectively fix their attention on one event. Fifty-two million people tuned in to the first debate four years ago, and 80 percent of the nation's adults reported watching at least a bit of the debates between Obama and Republican John McCain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a quadrennial pre-debate ritual, each campaign has worked overtime to raise expectations for the opponent while lowering the bar for its own candidate. The thinking is that it's better to exceed lukewarm expectations than to fail to perform at an anticipated level of great skill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But both men are seasoned debaters: Obama has been here before, facing off with McCain in 2008. Romney hasn't gone one-on-one in a presidential debate, but he got plenty of practice thinking on his feet during the 19 multi-candidate debates during the Republican primaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a long day of debate prep _ Romney in Denver and Obama in Henderson, Nev., near Las Vegas _ both candidates tried to blow off some steam Tuesday. The president made a tourist's visit to nearby Hoover Dam, and Romney fit in a lunchtime outing to a Mexican grill for a burrito bowl. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two candidates' biggest fans talked up their debating abilities in pre-debate interviews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michelle Obama told CNN she's like a nervous parent watching a child performing on the balance beam when her husband debates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I do tell him to have fun and relax and just be himself, because the truth is, if he's the Barack Obama the country has come to know and trust, he is going to do a great job,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney said her husband always looks around to find her in the debate audience and keeps a paper in front of him that says \"Dad\" _ to remind him to make his father proud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for her advice, Mrs. Romney told KMGH-TV in Denver that she tells her husband: \"Sweetie, you had five boys. You learned to argue really well and make your points years ago. Just go do that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's format: The moderator, PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, will open each 15-minute segment with a question, and then Obama and Romney will have two minutes apiece to answer. After that, it's up to Lehrer to keep the conversation going and to intervene if one candidate goes on too long.

One person declared it inedible, throwing it into the trash in a huff. Others, however, were particularly excited about this variety because its creme center features bits of crisped rice. Unlike the cookie dough variety, this cookie’s flavor corresponds with its name: it really does taste like a Rice Krispies Treat.

{"context": "Dinosaurs live and walk among us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not the big biters in “Jurassic World”—they’re digital, in case you were wondering—but the filmmakers and studio executives who perpetrated this lumbering edition of the franchise that Steven Spielberg launched more than two decades ago. The production was directed, clumsily, by Colin Trevorrow, from a remarkably incoherent script credited to Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly and Mr. Trevorrow. (The blame in that department may well start from the bottom of the list rather than the top.) “Jurassic World” is obviously critic-proof, though not invulnerable to word of mouth, which may prove to be less than ecstatic. Nothing said here will have the slightest bearing on its performance at the box office. All the same, something should be said about the film’s cheesiness—it doesn’t even look good, though it sounds grand—and the shoddiness of its workmanship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, the dinos fill the screen as advertised, and their conniption fits can be exciting from time to time, and from chase to incessant chase. But the sole source of buoyancy in the turgid spectacle is, predictably, Chris Pratt —predictably because his easy charm was what made “Guardians Of the Galaxy” a resounding hit. Now, as a raffish, good-hearted trainer named Owen, he’s a dino whisperer who has forged a special bond with several raptors in the park. Yet Mr. Pratt’s charm is no match for the crude filmmaking or the stupid plot that keeps him running around in a constant state of artificial animation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins roam among the dinosaurs in ‘Jurassic World.’ Photo: Universal Pictures NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story starts with a park that has grown into a vast and familiar tourist attraction since its earliest days. To draw more tourists in, Jurassic World’s geneticists have created a new wow factor, a spectacular albino hybrid, Indominus Rex, that the movie’s marketers describe, succinctly enough, with the tag line “Bigger. Louder. More Teeth.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plot pits shifting factions against each other. On one side is Owen, devoted to his animals. On the same side, though with emotional and professional reservations, is Claire ( Bryce Dallas Howard ), a martinet in high heels who runs the park with an iron hand, at least for a while. (She is also Aunt Claire to a couple of kids who spend most of the film in jeopardy, and throughout the frantic action she runs on her heels, persistently and amusingly, like a heroine from an old Irwin Allen adventure.) Arrayed against them are quasi-military contractors led by Hoskins ( Vincent D’Onofrio ), a nut job who wants to weaponize Owen’s raptors and use them in America’s foreign wars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Indominus Rex in ‘Jurassic World’ Photo: Universal Pictures NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are we clear about the terms of the conflict? We may think so for a while, but the script works itself into such a bewildering dither that Owen briefly joins forces with the bad guys when chaos threatens, and the raptors themselves seem at several points to change whatever passes for their minds. On top of that a lead character from the earlier films is resurrected, absurdly if thunderously, though by that time logic is in tatters along with the park and its home island of Isla Nublar. The film is being shown in both 2-D and 3-D flavors. I saw the 2-D version, so I may have missed something, but I’d say the ideal number of dimensions in which to see “Jurassic World” is none. ||||| When I saw the original \"Jurassic Park\" for the first time, it was a magical screening, held exclusively for the Universal tour guides. It was several weeks before the release of the movie, and they wanted to give us a chance to see it early and then spread the word on the trams about what it was they were about to release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I will always remember and revere the experience of seeing it in the Alfred Hitchcock Theater, in the room where the sound was actually mixed. When the T-rex attack began, everyone in the room stopped breathing. That may sound like an exaggeration, but the temperature went up so much during that one scene that people began sweating. In that one moment, Spielberg and his production team reached deep into our collective memory of being small furry things afraid of being eaten and tapped that fear in a very real and immediate way. It remains one of the single most effective sequences of terror ever captured on film, no matter what the rating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rest of \"Jurassic Park\"? Eh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's the sad truth about this series of films as a whole. They depend entirely on how you react to the set pieces in each film because as actual movies, they don't really work. I think the first film has that one great set piece, and I think the stuff with the raptors is fine, but not particularly amazing. I think the second film has about three great sequences. Both of those movies benefit enormously from the work by Jeff Goldblum, who should have been given an MVP Oscar for both of them. \"Jurassic Park III\" comes closer to working as a whole film, although I still think there's one set piece that leaves the entire rest of the film in the dust. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So when I say that \"Jurassic World\" may be the best entire movie in the series, I offer that with the caveat that there's no single moment in the film that is as great as the T-rex attack from the first film. But then again… not many films feature scenes that great, so it's a hard bar to use to judge what \"Jurassic World\" does well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First and foremost, I enjoyed the film as a reaction to \"Jurassic Park.\" It feels in some ways like this film has been bubbling around inside co-writer/director Colin Trevorrow ever since the 16-year-old him saw the first film in the theater. If they'd never made the other sequels, this one would make perfectly logical sense as a way to pick the series up now. There is no single human lead here; instead, they've created just enough of an excuse to get Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) into the park while Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) try to head off a crisis situation created in equal parts by Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) and the twisted work of Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong, the only returning cast member from the original). That's it. That's all the human stuff that matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I've already seen and heard a fair amount of fury and snark aimed at this film from some other critics, and while I would never say that I feel like this is a piercingly well-observed human story, everything's handled with a fairly light touch. The two kids are at the park to visit their aunt Claire because their parents are in the middle of negotiating a divorce, and I'll be honest… I hate the frequency with which divorce is used to simply drive plot in films. I am well aware that I am overly attuned to it right now, but it still drives me crazy. Thankfully, they don't dwell on it, and most of what happens between the brothers is just observational performance stuff, with the older brother constantly annoyed/embarrassed by his little brother, especially in front of girls. The same thing's true in the relationship between Owen and Claire. Pratt and Howard are given just enough character definition at the beginning of the film to give them things to do as they run and jump and scream for the rest of the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lately, I've taken some heat from some of you for the letter grades on these reviews, and I think it's interesting to see how many years we've been having this conversation and how much some of you still believe in film criticism as a binary thing. There is no \"right\" or \"wrong.\" There are certain technical crafts that I think are very important to the overall effectiveness of filmmaking, and there are certainly plenty of examples of ways you can hamhand things, but there is such a wide range of reactions that we all have to movies that you can't possibly look at my letter grade (something I'm not crazy about) as any sort of definitive statement on the film. All that grade indicates is how well I think the filmmakers accomplished their own goals with the film. Whether I enjoyed that or not is something that is far more complicated, and that's why I write a full review. If the letter grade was the whole story, then I'd feel like everything else I do is a waste of time, and that's certainly not the case. When I gave \"San Andreas\" a better grade than I gave \"Tomorrowland,\" that's not because I think \"San Andreas\" is a better film. I don't. I think Brad Bird's technical craftsmanship is top-notch, as good as anyone in this industry, and I think there are plenty of grace notes in \"Tomorrowland\" that prove that very skilled people were responsible for it. But \"San Andreas\" is better at delivering what it promises than \"Tomorrowland\" was, and the things that I think don't work at all about \"Tomorrowland\" hobble it in some pretty important ways for me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So while I can acknowledge that there are things about \"Jurassic World\" that feel perfunctory, the things I enjoyed about it far outweigh my complaints. There is something ridiculous about the entire conception of Pratt's character, but he sells it through performance, and the way it actually plays in the film makes sure to keep the raptors dangerous, even as it has fun with the idea of them running as a pack with a human in the lead. The film's big new invention, the Indominus Rex, is a fun movie monster because of how impossibly smart and suited to its environment it is, and because it is just a nasty killing machine, no mere animal. The film pretty much spells out what it wants to say thematically right up front, and while I like the target, I'm not sure they make the case for this being anything but part of the larger problem. The idea in the movie is that people got bored with the remarkable and have demanded an escalation in the years since, and that is very much the case in terms of blockbuster movies. The thing is, what ultimately breaks that formula is when someone remembers to include the human element given the same attention that the spectacle is given. The reason \"Guardians Of The Galaxy\" flattened people was because the film made us believe in the most outrageous characters on a deeply human level. The reason \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" turned out to be such a surprise is because of the way George Miller made everyone a character this time, allowing us to see ourselves in the characters. If you can combine the human with the fantastic and do both of them equally well, there's no limit to how much audiences will reward you. And if you can't do that, well, then make sure the spectacle works, because that's all you've got. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having said that, one of the things that results from the choice to use almost all CG instead of animatronics this time is a mobility that allows Trevorrow to be aggressive with his staging, and I really like how free the animals are here. Whether it's the big new one or some familiar faces who show up late in the game, these animals are anything but limited in terms of what they can do. There is one scene where they are clearly using an animatronic, and there's no coincidence that it's the scene where they put the greatest emotional demand on the actors involved. They need an actor to suddenly see these things as living beings, and so they gave her something real to play off of, with the results speaking for themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second half of this movie is where Trevorrow cuts loose, and there are some big kicks to be had. There are all sorts of great gags and beats as the dinosaurs rip hell out of this park. Even at the start of the film, though, things are kept brisk, and the Indominus Rex breaks out of its environment fairly early. Once it does, the film just keeps moving, and I think this has a fairly satisfying ending. Preposterous, yes, but satisfying in the world the movie has created. This actually feels like the first of the films where there are enough threads left unresolved to pick this story up without remaking the first film again. One noteworthy villain manages to skate completely, and there's no way a disaster of this size goes unpunished. Beyond that, there is no more control over these things, and the larger world outside the park may finally have to grapple with this disruption in the natural order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chris Pratt deserves to be the guy every studio is chasing right now, and he works hard to sell even the most insane things he's asked to do here. Bryce Dallas Howard has the more thankless role up front, but once the running and the terror start, she loosens up and starts to have more fun in the role. There are a few nice moments for Irrfan Khan and Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as well, and B.D. Wong seems to be extra-happy with everything they've given him to do here. I think D'Onofrio's character is by far the weakest link, the most pedestrian in terms of how he's imagined. What works best about the script by Trevorrow and Derek Connolly (along with Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver) is the way it keeps things rolling forward. They have some fun with the idea of what the actual park would look like and what attractions would be there, and I thought the use of Jimmy Fallon in the video that plays during the rides was a perfect touch. But when a film is corporate product to the degree that this one is, it's hard to criticize the machine too effectively. In many ways, this is the Indominus Rex. It is bigger and meaner and louder than its precursors, and it does exactly what it was bred to do. Like the \"Terminator\" series, though, I think the more times you return to the well, the more you reveal just how little narrative reason there is to tell further stories. At least Trevorrow seems to be genuinely enjoying what he's doing, and it's that sense of someone having fun behind the camera that ultimately won me over.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joss Whedon famously called a pre-release clip of \"Jurassic World\" \"'70s era sexist\" on Twitter. Hey, even \"Jurassic World\" director Colin Trevorrow agreed! While Whedon later apologized for voicing the sentiment (without actually backpedaling), his criticism is now being echoed by Daily Beast reviewer Marlow Stern, who calls the film a \"Big, Dumb, Sexist Mess\" in his headline before going on to write: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"'Jurassic World' is not about corporate greed, anti-militarization, crass commerciality, disrupting the food chain, or dinos eating the shit out of people. No. It’s about a woman’s 'evolution' from an icy-cold, selfish corporate shill into a considerate wife and mother.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stern is referring here to Bryce Dallas \"Not Jessica Chastain\" Howard's character Claire Dearing, who over the course of the film develops warm maternal feelings for her two young nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) despite starting out the film as a seemingly unfeeling operations manager. Continues Stern: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As Claire and [Chris Pratt's character] Owen travel through the dino-infested rainforests in search of the missing children, he begins to loosen her up through good ol’ fashioned sweet-talkin’. For God knows what reason, Claire is still sporting her work blouse and heels and is very much the distressed damsel, but what do you know, after a few witty barbs he convinces her to roll up her sleeves and tie her shirt in a bow. More sweaty forest shenanigans, and she loses the shirt. And then the heels. Once they’ve emerged from woods, and after avoiding certain death several times, she’s born again: a sweaty, humorous, maternal woman who’s severed her ties to her job and is only concerned with saving her two boys. Oh, and she’s got a man, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is even more evidence of this strange narrative, although revealing more would ruin the ending, so we’ll spare the spoilers. Suffice it to say the climax and conclusion of the film really hammers home the unsettling 'path to motherhood' journey.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over at the Guardian, meanwhile, Claire has scored a not-great 5/10 on the site's \"Sexismometer\" -- markedly higher than murderous super-dino Indominus Rex (scoring a 1/10) but lower, at least, than Judy Greer's character Karen (8/10), who apparently spends the majority of the film sobbing over a phone. Here's Guardian contributor Catherine Shoard to explain: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"...as the film progresses and crisis worsens, Claire sheds her inhibitions as well as her clothes. She softens towards Owen as species survival becomes more critical, and towards her nephews as her own inadequacy as an aunt (as well as a potential mother) is exposed.

Food companies and restaurants could soon face government pressure to make their... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Food and Drug Administration is preparing voluntary guidelines asking the food industry to lower sodium levels, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told The Associated Press. Hamburg said in a recent interview that the sodium is \"of huge interest and concern\" to the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We believe we can make a big impact working with the industry to bring sodium levels down, because the current level of consumption really is higher than it should be for health,\" Hamburg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's still unclear when FDA will release the guidelines, despite its 2013 goal to have them completed this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamburg said she hoped the agency would be able to publicly discuss the issue \"relatively soon.\" On Tuesday, FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said there is no set timeline for their release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The food industry has already made some reductions, and has prepared for government action since a 2010 Institute of Medicine report said companies had not made enough progress on making foods less salty. The IOM advised the government to establish maximum sodium levels for different foods, though the FDA said then — and maintains now — that it favors a voluntary route. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Americans eat about 1½ teaspoons of salt daily, about a third more than the government recommends for good health and enough to increase the risk of high blood pressure, strokes and other problems. Most of that sodium is hidden inside common processed foods and restaurant meals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to flavor, companies use sodium to increase shelf life, prevent the growth of bacteria, or improve texture and appearance. That makes it more difficult to remove from some products, Hamburg noted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once the guidelines are issued, Americans won't notice an immediate taste difference in higher-sodium foods like pizza, pasta, bread and soups. The idea would be to encourage gradual change so consumers' taste buds can adjust, and to give the companies time to develop lower-sodium foods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think one of the things we are very mindful of is that we need to have a realistic timeline,\" Hamburg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health groups would prefer mandatory standards, but say voluntary guidelines are a good first step. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says he is concerned companies may hesitate, worried that their competitors won't lower sodium in their products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If that happens, \"then FDA should start a process of mandatory limits,\" Jacobson says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's what companies are worried about. Though the limits would be voluntary, the FDA is at heart a regulatory agency, and the guidelines would be interpreted as a stern warning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brian Kennedy of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents the country's biggest food companies, says the group is concerned about the FDA setting targets and any guidelines should be based on a \"rigorous assessment of all available scientific evidence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The food industry has pointed to a separate 2013 IOM report that said there is no good evidence that eating sodium at very low levels — below the 2,300 milligrams a day that the government recommends — offers benefits. The government recommends that those older than 50, African-Americans and people with high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease eat 1,500 milligrams a day. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat no more than 1,500 milligrams a day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lanie Friedman of ConAgra Foods, one of the companies that would be subject to the voluntary guidelines, says the newer IOM report is a \"paradigm change\" and more research is needed. But those pushing for sodium limits say it's pointless to debate how low the recommendations should go — Americans are still eating around 3,400 milligrams a day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many food companies and retailers already have pushed to reduce salt. Wal-Mart pledged to reduce sodium in many items by 25 percent by next year, and food giant ConAgra Foods says it made a 20 percent reduction. Subway restaurants said it has made a 30 percent reduction restaurant-wide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The companies say that in some cases, just removing added salt or switching ingredients does the trick. Potassium chloride can also substitute for common salt (sodium chloride), though too much can cause a metallic taste. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Levels of sodium in food can vary widely. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sodium in a slice of white bread ranges from 80 milligrams to 230 milligrams. Three ounces of turkey deli meat can have 450 milligrams to 1,050 milligrams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those ranges give health advocates hope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those differences say to me that the companies that make the highest-sodium products could certainly reduce levels to the same as the companies that make the lower-sodium products,\" Jacobson says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the guidelines could be a hard sell. In recent years, congressional Republicans have fought the Obama administration over efforts to require calorie labels on menus and make school lunches healthier. When the administration attempted to create voluntary guidelines for advertising junk food for children, the industry balked and Republicans in Congress fought the idea, prompting the administration to put them aside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other members of Congress are pushing the agency to act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As the clock ticks, America's blood pressure, along with health costs due to chronic disease, continues to rise,\" says Sen.

{"context": "Image caption Life would face challenges on Mars today, but billions of years ago conditions might have been better NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life may have started on Mars before arriving on Earth, a major scientific conference has heard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New research supports an idea that the Red Planet was a better place to kick-start biology billions of years ago than the early Earth was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evidence is based on how the first molecules necessary for life were assembled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evidence seems to be building that we are actually all Martians; that life started on Mars and came to Earth on a rock Prof Steven Benner, Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Details of the theory were outlined by Prof Steven Benner at the Goldschmidt Meeting in Florence, Italy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have long wondered how atoms first came together to make up the three crucial molecular components of living organisms: RNA, DNA and proteins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The molecules that combined to form genetic material are far more complex than the primordial \"pre-biotic\" soup of organic (carbon-based) chemicals thought to have existed on the Earth more than three billion years ago, and RNA (ribonucleic acid) is thought to have been the first of them to appear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simply adding energy such as heat or light to the more basic organic molecules in the \"soup\" does not generate RNA. Instead, it generates tar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RNA needs to be coaxed into shape by \"templating\" atoms at the crystalline surfaces of minerals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The minerals most effective at templating RNA would have dissolved in the oceans of the early Earth, but would have been more abundant on Mars, according to Prof Benner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Red or dead NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This could suggest that life started on the Red Planet before being transported to Earth on meteorites, argues Prof Benner, of the Westheimer Institute of Science and Technology in Gainesville, US.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea that life originated on Mars and was then transported to our planet has been mooted before. But Prof Benner's ideas add another twist to the theory of a Martian origin for the terrestrial biosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here in Florence, Prof Benner presented results that suggest minerals containing the elements boron and molybdenum are key in assembling atoms into life-forming molecules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researcher points out that boron minerals help carbohydrate rings to form from pre-biotic chemicals, and then molybdenum takes that intermediate molecule and rearranges it to form ribose, and hence RNA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This raises problems for how life began on Earth, since the early Earth is thought to have been unsuitable for the formation of the necessary boron and molybdenum minerals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that the boron minerals needed to form RNA from pre-biotic soups were not available on early Earth in sufficient quantity, and the molybdenum minerals were not available in the correct chemical form. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption Meteorites from Mars have been arriving on Earth throughout our planet's history NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof Benner explained: \"It’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This form of molybdenum couldn’t have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because three billion years ago, the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Mars is also thought to have had a drier environment, and this is also crucial to its favourable location for life's origins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What’s quite clear is that boron, as an element, is quite scarce in Earth’s crust,\" Prof Benner told BBC News, “but Mars has been drier than Earth and more oxidising, so if Earth is not suitable for the chemistry, Mars might be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The evidence seems to be building that we are actually all Martians; that life started on Mars and came to Earth on a rock,\" he commented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It’s lucky that we ended up here, nevertheless - as certainly Earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence is building that Earth life originated on Mars and was brought to this planet aboard a meteorite, said biochemist Steven Benner of The Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An oxidized form of the element molybdenum, which may have been crucial to the origin of life, was likely available on the Red Planet's surface long ago, but unavailable on Earth, said Benner, who presented his findings today (Aug. 28; Aug. 29 local time) at the annual Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Florence, Italy. [The Search for Life on Mars (Photo Timeline)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidized that it is able to influence how early life formed,\" Benner said in a statement. \"This form of molybdenum couldn’t have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because 3 billion years ago, the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did. It’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organic compounds are the building blocks of life, but they need a little help to make things happen. Simply adding energy such as heat or light turns a soup of organic molecules into a tarlike substance, Benner said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's where oxidized molybdenum comes in. Inserting it or boron, another element, into the mix would help organics make the leap to life, Benner added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Analysis of a Martian meteorite recently showed that there was boron on Mars; we now believe that the oxidized form of molybdenum was there, too,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another point in Mars' favor is the likelihood that the early Earth was completely covered by water while the ancient Red Planet had substantial dry areas, Benner said. All of this liquid would have made it difficult for boron, which is currently found only in extremely dry places, to form in high enough concentrations on Earth when life was first evolving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further, Benner added, water is corrosive to RNA, which most researchers think was the first genetic molecule (rather than DNA, which came later).

{"context": "Scientists at the University of Cambridge have completed the world's largest ever study of typical sex differences and autistic traits. They tested and confirmed two long-standing psychological theories: the Empathizing-Systemizing theory of sex differences and the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Working with the television production company Channel 4, they tested over half a million people, including over 36,000 autistic people. The results are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Empathizing-Systemizing theory predicts that women, on average, will score higher than men on tests of empathy, the ability to recognize what another person is thinking or feeling, and to respond to their state of mind with an appropriate emotion. Similarly, it predicts that men, on average, will score higher on tests of systemizing, the drive to analyse or build rule-based systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Extreme Male Brain theory predicts that autistic people, on average, will show a masculinised shift on these two dimensions: namely, that they will score lower than the typical population on tests of empathy and will score the same as if not higher than the typical population on tests of systemizing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whereas both theories have been confirmed in previous studies of relatively modest samples, the new findings come from a massive sample of 671,606 people, which included 36,648 autistic people. They were replicated in a second sample of 14,354 people. In this new study, the scientists used very brief 10-item measures of empathy, systemizing, and autistic traits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using these short measures, the team identified that in the typical population, women, on average, scored higher than men on empathy, and men, on average, scored higher than women on systemizing and autistic traits. These sex differences were reduced in autistic people. On all these measures, autistic people's scores, on average, were 'masculinized': that is, they had higher scores on systemizing and autistic traits and lower scores on empathy, compared to the typical population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team also calculated the difference (or 'd-score') between each individual's score on the systemizing and empathy tests. A high d-score means a person's systemizing is higher than their empathy, and a low d-score means their empathy is higher than their systemizing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They found that in the typical population, men, on average, had a shift towards a high d-score, whereas women, on average, had a shift towards a low d-score. Autistic individuals, on average, had a shift towards an even higher d-score than typical males. Strikingly, d-scores accounted for 19 times more of the variance in autistic traits than other variables, including sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, men, on average, had higher autistic trait scores than women. Those working in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), on average, had higher systemizing and autistic traits scores than those in non-STEM occupations. And conversely, those working in non-STEM occupations, on average, had had higher empathy scores than those working in STEM. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the paper, the authors discuss how it is important to bear in mind that differences observed in this study apply only to group averages, not to individuals. They underline that these data say nothing about an individual based on their gender, autism diagnosis, or occupation. To do that would constitute stereotyping and discrimination, which the authors strongly oppose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further, the authors reiterate that the two theories are applicable to only two dimensions of typical sex differences: empathy and systemizing. They do not apply to all sex differences, such as aggression, and to extrapolate the theories beyond these two dimensions would be a misinterpretation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, the authors highlight that although autistic people on average struggle with 'cognitive' empathy - recognizing other people's thoughts and feelings - they nevertheless have intact 'affective' empathy - they care about others. It is a common misunderstanding that autistic people struggle with all forms of empathy, which is untrue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Varun Warrier, from the Cambridge team, said: \"These sex differences in the typical population are very clear. We know from related studies that individual differences in empathy and systemizing are partly genetic, partly influenced by our prenatal hormonal exposure, and partly due to environmental experience. We need to investigate the extent to which these observed sex differences are due to each of these factors, and how these interact.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr David Greenberg, from the Cambridge team, said: \"Big data is important to draw conclusions that are replicable and robust. This is an example of how scientists can work with the media to achieve big data science.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Carrie Allison, from the Cambridge team, said: \"We are grateful to both the general public and to the autism community for participating in this research. The next step must be to consider the relevance of these findings for education, and support where needed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge who proposed these two theories nearly two decades ago, said: \"This research provides strong support for both theories. This study also pinpoints some of the qualities autistic people bring to neurodiversity. They are, on average, strong systemizers, meaning they have excellent pattern-recognition skills, excellent attention to detail, and an aptitude in understanding how things work. We must support their talents so they achieve their potential - and society benefits too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ### NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you'd like to complete these measures and participate in studies at the Autism Research Centre please register here: http://www. cambridgepsychology. com NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Autism Research Centre (ARC) at the University of Cambridge conducts research on both the causes of and interventions for autism.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite criticism from GOP rivals, Trump isn’t backing down from his comments about how Mexico is “forcing” their undesirables into the United States, saying now that “tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump went after the media for “distorting” what he said and, of course, also used the occasion to rail against all the companies distancing themselves from him, declaring they’ve “all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also invoked Univision’s recently-announced plan to go public and bragged about how there were “many rave ‘reviews'” of his Mexico remarks at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, of course, presenting Trump in anything other than complete context would be a disservice, so here’s The Donald’s full statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Statement from Donald J. Trump: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech. Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They’re not sending you (pointing again). They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. They’re bringing drugs.They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people! But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn’t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans—many of them are working for and with me…and, just like our country, my organization is better for it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it’s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade … and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend…and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesn’t want me to say. In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States. I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President. Macy’s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government. The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border–only legally approved people will come through easily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock price—not to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract. Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest backers. After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave “reviews”—there was very little criticism. It wasn’t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again! Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Divided Mexico unites against Trump: 'He has no respect for human beings' Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The would-be president and billionaire businessman, who has already branded Mexican immigrants to the US as criminals, drug dealers and rapists, accused the Mexican government of “forcing their most unwanted people into the United States” which has become a “dumping ground for Mexico”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government,” Trump said in a statement he released on Monday, which criticised the media for deliberately distorting his earlier remarks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The border patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who has lost several business deals as a result of his comments about Mexico, said his previous remarks – “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists” – could not have been “simpler or more accurately stated”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc,” Trump said. “This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a five-time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn’t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He attempted to temper his comments by saying that as well as the criminal immigrants, “many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am proud to say that I know many hard-working Mexicans – many of them are working for and with me … and, just like our country, my organization is better for it,” he said. “I have great respect for Mexico and I love their people and their people’s great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said his message to citizens of the United States was that “the Mexican government is not our friend”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s statement is full of highly questionable assertions, however, starting with the idea that immigrants are flowing unchecked over the Mexico border. Data from both the US and Mexican governments shows that net immigration has actually been steadily falling in recent years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea that the Mexican government is “forcing their most unwanted people into the United States” also seems to have little basis in reality: in the past year a crackdown by Mexican forces has dramatically reduced the flow of migrants into the US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, migration experts often stress that the migrants prepared to take the considerable risks of heading north tend to be among the most determined, hard-working and ambitious family members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nor is there much evidence to back Trump’s assertion that the Mexican government wants a one-way border into the United States. President Enrique Peña Nieto’s government is frequently criticized in Mexico for doing very little to push for a relaxation of the border or lobby for the rights of Mexican immigrants. The only major migration-related initiative attributed to the government in an effort to achieve such goals is the allegation that it is cracking down on Central American migrants in transit through Mexico in order to get privileges for Mexicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said he “lost a lot during the presidential run defending the people of the United States” including deals with department store Macy’s, NBC, Univision and a host of other TV networks and sports organisations including Nascar. “Macy’s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This past weekend, the former Apprentice star said that while the outcry may have hurt him financially, his open criticism was helping his cause as voters agreed with him. “I believe in punching back. You know I don’t think they’ve [the media] treated me fairly,” he said on Fox News Sunday. “A while ago they said he’s never going to run, he’s never going to run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then I ran. Then they said, ‘He’s never going to file his papers.’ Then I filed my papers. Now they don’t know what to say. Now, all of the sudden, I get these really big poll numbers. And, they’re really good. Although I think they’re going to go higher because I really think people agree with what I say about the border and just agree with me, period.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In several recent polls Trump was behind only Jeb Bush in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. ||||| Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.

CLICK TO ENLARGE (WHATCOM COUNTY, WA.) -- Once again the long, patient arm of the law has reached out, after untold numbers of dedicated investigators hours over the years, to make an arrest in a murder case so old that many people in Whatcom County may have thought would never be solved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And once again, decades old DNA paved the way for an arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the Whatcom County Sheriff's office announced the arrest of a man they believe was the perpetrator in the 1989 abduction, rape and murder of then 18-year old Amanda (Mandy) Stavik. The man lived near the slain woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff's office outlined the developments in that case this way: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 24th, 1989 at about 1:50 p.m.(the day after Thanksgiving) 18-year old Amanda Stavik left her home on Strand Road to go jogging with the family dog. The dog returned home several hours later, but Mandy did not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After an extensive search, her body was found in the South Fork of the Nooksack River. Year after year went by without an arrest but, \"The investigation into the kidnapping, rape and murder of Mandy Stavik has remained a top priority for the Sheriff’s Office,\" said sheriff Bill Elfo in a statement issued Wednesday. \"Over the course of the last 28+ years, hundreds of leads emerged and were systematically investigated. Over the past decades, the community was repeatedly asked for assistance in solving the case. Information was received, pertaining to hundreds of potential suspects and leads that were followed up locally, in other states and foreign countries including Asia. During the course of the investigation, deputies consulted closely with forensic experts and renowned homicide investigators,\" added Elfo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A suspect arrested NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the potential suspects that emerged in recent years was a man named Timothy F. Bass, now 50 years old of Everson, Washington, a small town of about 2500 people in the county located on the banks of the Nooksack River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time of Mandy's murder Bass lived on Strand Road not far from Mandy’s residence. Deputies forwarded DNA samples from Mr. Bass to the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory which reported, after testing, that Bass's DNA matched DNA recovered from Mandy’s body in 1989. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Laboratory determined that the match probability was 1 in 11 quadrillion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bass was arrested by Sheriff’s Office Detectives on Tuesday of this week on suspicion of the First Degree Murder, First Degree Kidnapping and First Degree Rape of Mandy Stavik and remains in the Whatcom County jail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff Elfo asks that anyone in the community who may have information regarding Timothy Bass that may be helpful to his agency's investigation contact detectives at the Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office at (360)778-6600. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A call center was activated immediately after a news briefing on Wednesday to discuss the case with reporters. Calls will be taken in person and detectives will be standing by to evaluate information that is received. The number for the call center is (360) 788-5303. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mandy was first year college student when she vanished NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff Elfo said at the time of her murder, \"Mandy was a bright young first-year student at Central Washington University and well known in the east Whatcom County community. She had graduated from Mount Baker High School earlier in the year. She would have celebrated her 46th birthday this year. Her brutal murder rocked the community and she is still well remembered by many. We hope that this arrest will help bring closure to Mandy’s family and the community.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that the matter remains an active criminal investigation and noted that members of the Sheriff’s Office \"have poured their hearts and souls into this case over the past three decades.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also thanked the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory for the lab's \"invaluable assistance over the years.\" The use of DNA in forensic science was relatively new in 1989. Elfo said the collection and safe storage over the years of the DNA samples that were captured 28 long years ago made solving this murder case possible.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo said DNA evidence led to the arrest of 50-year-old Timothy Bass of Everson on Tuesday, The Bellingham Herald reported . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff's detectives arrested Bass on suspicion of murder, kidnapping and rape. He appeared in court Wednesday afternoon where bail was set at $1 million. It wasn't immediately clear if Bass had a lawyer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mandy Stavik vanished in 1989 on the Friday after Thanksgiving while jogging near her home east of Bellingham in Acme. A 1989 graduate of Mount Baker High, Stavik was home on break from her freshman year at Central Washington University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When her German shepherd returned home alone, a search for the 18-year-old woman began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A volunteer firefighter found her body during a search three days later in the South Fork of the Nooksack River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think this about the biggest case ever in Whatcom County,\" Elfo said on Wednesday, adding that detectives have worked the case \"doggedly\" for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cause of Stavik's death was listed as not inconsistent with drowning. Authorities said she may have been alive when she was dumped in the river. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elfo said Bass was a neighbor of Stavik's at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bass was a suspect for several years, but his DNA wasn't obtained until September, Elfo said. Evidence presented in court Wednesday showed that Bass's DNA was obtained through a co-worker. According to the Bellingham Herald, Whatcom County Prosecutor Dave McEachran said that the co-worker gave detectives a plastic glass and Coke can Bass had drank from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Deputies forwarded DNA samples from Mr. Bass to the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory who reported that this DNA matched DNA recovered from Mandy's body in 1989,\" Elfo said.

{"context": "A Bay State solar panel developer that landed a state loan from Mitt Romney when he was Massachusetts governor has gone belly up — a day after the GOP presidential hopeful ripped President Obama’s green-energy investments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lowell-based Konarka Technologies announced late yesterday that it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and will cease operations, lay off its 85 workers and liquidate. ||||| WASHINGTON It would be a triumphant moment for any governor: A cutting-edge company announces plans to build a new plant that will create hundreds of high-paying jobs and bolster one of the state's most prominent industries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Mitt Romney, the June 2006 announcement by drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb served as a signature accomplishment as his four-year stint as Massachusetts governor drew to a close and a U.S. presidential bid beckoned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new facility came with a price tag: Romney and other state officials agreed to $67 million in tax breaks and other inducements to ensure the New York-based company picked Massachusetts over rival states like North Carolina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now as he mounts his second White House bid, Romney is hammering President Barack Obama for playing favorites with green-tech companies rather than letting businesses succeed or fail on their own. Romney is the presumptive Republican challenger to face Obama, a Democrat, in the November 6 election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Obama is giving taxpayer money to big donors and then watching them lose it,\" Romney's campaign said in an Internet video released on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a powerful line of attack that connects failed ventures like Solyndra, the bankrupt California-based solar panel maker that defaulted on a $535 million loan from the U.S. Energy Department, with the trillion-dollar budget deficits and sluggish U.S. economy of the past four years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it might invite unfavorable comparison with Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. During that time, Romney pursued a hands-on approach to economic development that favored some industries over others and, in some instances, singled out individual firms for special favors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney, a former private equity executive, backed tax breaks for film makers and biotech and medical-device manufacturers. His administration promoted venture capital-style funds that extended loans to start-up companies, some of which subsequently went out of business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the state's top salesman, he led the effort to lure desirable employers through tax breaks and other incentives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's what governors do - they have to pick winners and losers,\" said Boston University professor Fred Bayles. \"It's a calculated risk that governors and state politicians take in an effort to get jobs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sometimes, as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Romney's efforts panned out. Other times they did not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A $2.5 million state loan helped lure Rhode Island biotech firm Spherics Inc across the state line to Massachusetts in 2005. Romney's economic development secretary, Ranch Kimball, touted the move as \"a tangible result of the combined and coordinated efforts of the public and private sectors to highlight the benefits of locating in Massachusetts.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company shut down three years later, laying off all of its employees and defaulting on $1.5 million of the loan, according to MassDevelopment, the state development authority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics on the left say Romney would have been better off investing in education and transportation to boost the state's business climate over the long term. Critics on the right say he should have concentrated on lowering business taxes overall, rather than aiding selected industries or companies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'MAKES NO SENSE' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It makes no sense to give tax breaks to some companies and not others when the solution lies in making the tax code m ore investment friendly,\" said David Tuerck, who heads the Beacon Hill Institute, a conservative Massachusetts think tank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic research group, noted that while Romney the candidate opposes government intervention in business, many of the companies he owned during his time as head of private equity firm Bain Capital took advantage of government subsidies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In many ways Romney's whole approach to the economy is hypocritical,\" said American Bridge president Rodell Mollineau. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney's defenders say he was just doing his job as governor. Though a hub of innovation and research, Massachusetts has a high cost of living and a reputation for being hostile to business that often put it at a disadvantage compared with other states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In such an environment, incentives are sometimes needed to lure marquee employers, but they were never the primary emphasis of Romney's salesmanship, Romney backers say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"States are different from the federal government in that we are absolutely competing for businesses with other states,\" said Jim Stergios, who worked to streamline regulations as a member of Romney's administration. \"Do you go back to Bristol-Myers Squibb and say, 'I know North Carolina is offering you $70 million and we're not going to offer you anything?' You've got to be in the game.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campaigning for governor in 2002, Romney said he would not rely on special breaks or other \"corporate welfare\" to stem an exodus of manufacturing jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are some companies that are only interested in tax breaks. Let them go to Alabama,\" Romney said at a news conference in October 2002. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Less than three weeks after taking office in 2003, Romney announced a new $15 million green-energy fund to help renewable-energy businesses in the state. A solar-panel company, two fuel-cell firms, a methane-gas facility and another firm got a total of $9 million in state funds in help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'MAJOR ECONOMIC SPRINGBOARD' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In remarks at Konarka, a Lowell solar-panel firm that got a $1.5 million state loan, Romney said he hoped the green-energy fund \"can become a major economic springboard in the renewable energy sector,\" according to a news release at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney also signed off on a $12.5 million Emergency Technology fund for the state to help high-risk technology startups. The program since then has aided companies like E Ink, which developed the technology used in Amazon.com's Kindle e-reader, but has also lost money on some of its investments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along with Spherics, the program lost an undisclosed amount of money on a $2 million loan to biotech firm Acusphere, according to MassDevelopment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney campaign officials say it is inaccurate to compare either fund with the Obama administration's loan program that backed Solyndra and other green-tech companies. Republicans have criticized Obama's program as a costly boondoggle that rewarded politically connected businesses and interfered with market forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney campaign officials point out that both funds were overseen by independent agencies, not political appointees. Romney used existing money from an underused trust to set up the green-energy fund, and he vetoed the venture-capital portion of the technology fund before it was restored by the Democratic-controlled state legislature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Governor Romney is proud of the record he had of making Massachusetts a pro-business environment that added jobs,\" said a Romney campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney also centered a 2003 economic-development bill around tax credits for biotech and medical-device manufacturers that create jobs. It is hard to tell if they had an impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Employment in the biotech sector rose 25 percent from 2002 to 2006, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, a trade group. But federal statistics indicate that the state lost 4 percent of its pharmaceutical-manufacturing jobs and 20 percent of its medical-equipment manufacturing jobs during that period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation under Romney's tenure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney's economic-development efforts did not move the needle much one way or the other, said Leigh McIlvaine, an analyst with Good Jobs First, a left-leaning research group that tracks economic-development subsidies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He was betting just as blindly as anyone else was during that time,\" McIlvaine said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney backed a much bigger tax break for the movie industry in November 2005, signing a bill that would give tax credits of up to $7 million for productions that film in the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subsidies like these have been criticized as inefficient, while backers say they are needed to support a home-grown film industry and can boost tourism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The program had generated about 1,700 in-state jobs through 2010, costing the state $142,500 in lost tax revenue for each job, according to the Massachusetts tax office. The state had gotten back 13 cents for every dollar it gave up in tax revenue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the case of Bristol Myers-Squibb, backers can point to tangible results. The $750 million facility, completed in 2011, now employs 350 people. It employed 1,000 contractors at the height of construction, according to the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state issued $34 million in bonds to build new sewage facilities at the site, a former Army base, and agreed to modify an existing tax credit so the company could get back $33 million from the state. Labor leaders agreed to build the facility at reduced rates. The town where the plant was built agreed to allow it to be taller than local limits would have permitted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Lynch, an economics professor at Washington College in Maryland, said that broadly speaking these types of incentives have not been shown to make a difference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They probably could have spent the money more effectively in other ways,\" Lynch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Editing by Alistair Bell and Will Dunham)"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sometimes it takes a clown to show us how foolish we’ve become. Last month, comedian Jon Stewart, popular host of Comedy Central’s, whose satirical fake news reporting has become a force to be reckoned with in US politics, announced he would be holding a Rally to Restore Sanity on the Washington Mall on October 30th.“A million moderates march, where we take to the streets to send a message to our leaders and our national media that says, ‘We are here! We... are only here until 6 though, because we have a sitter,” Stewart quipped.Stewart’s sidekick Stephen Colbert, whose show airs immediately afterwards, announced in response that he would hold a rival rally at the same place and time with the intent of “keeping fear alive.” “Now is not the time to take it down a notch,” he retorted in the faux persona of a conservative pundit. “Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom.”The idea behind the two rallies is to spoof the kind of blatant partisanship and irresponsible fear-stoking which seems to have taken hold of the discourse in the US. But while the gathering is promised to be chock-full of laughs, it touches on a serious issue extremely relevant to our sanity-parched part of the world.HERE, AS in the US, important debates are often hijacked by those on the fringe who seek to promote their own agendas by exploiting our fears. In the US, this manifests itself through such bogus claims as Obama is a secret Muslim, fascist or communist (never mind the inherent contradiction between the last two terms); or, conversely, by outrageous accusations that former president George W. Bush masterminded 9/11 to invade Iraq.Here, too, sometimes it seems like only those shouting loudest are the ones being heard. All too often people are quick to attach labels to those they disagree with. Settlers are fascists. Leftists are traitors. Israeli Arabs are a fifth column. Palestinians are terrorists. Religious Jews are fanatics. Secular Jews are assimilated.If we made an effort to respect each other a little bit more, things could be different.This is not to say that the Middle East as a whole and Israel in particular are not facing serious challenges. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems as intractable as ever. Relations between the religious and secular, Jews and Arabs, Ashkenazis and Sephardis and rich and poor are at peril. And let’s not forget Iran’s nuclear ambitions.All these issues pose serious internal and external threats which must be reckoned with. But irresponsible conduct and partisan reporting certainly aren’t going to help.Our politicians, media and we, ourselves, must set higher standards – to be more balanced, more responsible, less prone to exaggeration and less disrespectful of each other.TO ACHIEVE that lofty goal, I propose that the first item on our agenda be to hold a local chapter of the prank rally in Washington organized by two comedians.If such a protest were held, it might not bring peace to the Middle East but it might help promote just a little humor and good will in the region, and that in itself would already be a great start.There’s only one problem. How does one restore sanity to a part of the world where it never existed? I therefore propose calling the gathering in Israel the Rally toSanity.Call me crazy if you will, but if you live in a part of the world which quite often resembles a madhouse, following the lead of a court jester might be the sanest thing to do.The Jerusalem Post’s ||||| Kittie Brown's gathering in Paris will be one among more than 800 happening in 67 countries as Jon Stewart's 'Rally to Restore Sanity' gains global appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jon Stewart's \"Rally to Restore Sanity\" has gone global, sparking sister rallies from Tel Aviv to Mt. Everest Base Camp on Oct. 30, the same day that Mr. Stewart will convene a gathering of like-minded cohorts on the Washington Mall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everyone was getting excited\" about the rally in Washington, says Kittie Brown, a marketing consultant and mother of three who lives in Paris. \"I thought, 'Gosh, why couldn’t we just do something local?'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And so Ms. Brown did. Through Facebook she is organizing a gathering in Champs de Mars park, with at least 100 people currently expected to attend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We’ll be doing it sanely and calmly and with a sense of humor. Which is a change from what's been happening,\" she says in a telephone interview, giving a wink to the violent French protests in recent days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris rally will be one among more than 800 happening in 67 countries, showing the popularity of Stewart and the ability of national topics such as his rally to quickly morph into international events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Internet amplifies sentiments NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps more importantly, says Archon Fung of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, the rally underscores a growing appetite for more level-headed discourse. \"It’s weird to see people so worked up for the sake of a more rational political process,\" says the professor of democracy and citizenship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Fung points out that even the grassroots coffee party, which lacks a popular leader like Stewart, accrued tens of thousands of followers within weeks of its founding last spring in its call for calm, reasonable debate over the role of government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Internet only amplifies these movements, says Philip Seib, a professor of journalism, public diplomacy, and international relations at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. \"I would think we’re going to have more and more phenomenon that start national and become global.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid all the Internet chatter about Stewart's rally and fellow comedian Stephen Colbert's rival \"March to Keep Fear Alive,\" he says, \"It’s a relatively easy matter for someone in Tel Aviv to say, ‘We’ve all been reading about this on the web. Why don’t we do it?’\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which is exactly what's happening. A gathering at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque will watch the rally live in Washington. “Now is OUR time to join forces and bring the people to the streets,” the event organizers wrote on Facebook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stewart's rally, which comes in response to conservative television host Glenn Beck's Aug. 28 rally at the Lincoln Memorial, advertises itself as \"for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn’t be the only ones that get heard.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Promoting the Tel Aviv sister rally in The Jerusalem Post, an op-ed laments: \"Here, too, sometimes it seems like only those shouting loudest are the ones being heard. ... There’s only one problem. How does one restore sanity to a part of the world where it never existed? I therefore propose calling the gathering in Israel the Rally to Introduce Sanity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Mt. Everest Base Camp NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similar Facebook-organized rallies may happen in Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen, Montreal, New Zealand, and Melbourne (at the Birrarung Marr BBQ Area near the river, in case you’re interested). Organizers plan to watch the rally live or show a taping. While many attendants appear to be American expatriates, locals are also joining in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s even a sister rally at Mt. Everest Base Camp in Nepal, with organizer Scott Sevens of Las Vegas collecting Tibetan prayer flags for the event. “This rally will include some Tibetan-style symbolism,\" he states on Facebook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Americans living abroad, says Ms. Brown of the Paris rally, the anger seen in the tea party is alarming. \"They’re so rabid in their protest style,\" she says. \"It seems really bizarre, like America is losing its sense of humor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The little 'Jon Stewarts' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only Americans abroad watch \"The Daily Show\" or will be attending the \"sanity\" rallies around the world, says Professor Seib. In Dubai and Kuwait, where he says he recently visited, many locals watch \"The Daily Show\" frequently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think one of the reasons Jon Stewart is so popular in the US, and this would carry over elsewhere, is that despite the fact that he says this is basically a comedy show, it is also, in many instances, an alternative journalism,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"His questions are well researched, he asks solid follow-ups ... and when you mix that with the sarcastic critique of events and policies, that has pretty substantial audience appeal. And the one thing he does not do, is he doesn’t waste time as many mainstream news organizations do chasing the celebrity scandal of the moment. He uses the conventional media as a foil and that also enhances his popularity,\" says Seib. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People are dissatisfied with conventional or mainstream journalism,\" he adds. \"That holds true in a country like Israel or the rest of the world.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And just as smaller \"sanity\" rallies are popping up worldwide, Seib says he would expect little \"Jon Stewarts\" to appear around the world, inspired by the American comedian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, the magazine Foreign Policy recently profiled some of those people in a story titled, aptly, \"The World's Jon Stewarts.\""}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty years ago two baby girls were mixed up at a clinic in the French Riviera city of Cannes, southern France and ended up growing up in the wrong families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, a court in the southern town of Grasse ordered the clinic at the centre of the mix-up to pay €1.88 million ($2.13 million) -- six times less than the families had called for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had initially sued the hospital for €12 million, but in the end the court ordered €400,000 for each of the two children, €300,000 for each affected parent and €60,000 for each brother and sister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the court threw out a suit against doctors and obstetricians also brought by the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the mothers, Sophie Serrano, 38, voiced her joy and \"relief\" at the decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Finally, after so many years, the error has been recognised. Now, I'm cleared of everything. I've no reason any more to feel guilty for anything,\" Serrano told French television channel iTele. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The extraordinary story began on July 4th, 1994, when Serrano gave birth to Manon in the clinic in the Riviera city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The infant was suffering from jaundice and was placed in an incubator equipped with special lights to treat the problem next to another little girl, Mélanie, who was suffering from the same condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a hospital worker later returned the wrong babies to their respective parents, according to an inquiry that was conducted a decade later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mothers sensed something was wrong, and Mrs Serrano pointed out to hospital staff that her daughter had light skin but now appeared much darker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staff dismissed her concerns, saying that the difference was due to the effects of the lamps in the incubator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But over the following years the doubts grew ever stronger. Manon Serrano was frequently teased in her village near Cannes about being the “postman’s daughter” because she did not resemble her father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The father finally decided to get a paternity test done when she was ten. It proved that he was not her biological father. But the even bigger shock to the family was that it also proved that Sophie Serrano was not the child’s mother.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They took my innocence away,” Manon Serrano told Nice-Matin newspaper. “They took away my dreams, my hopes, my desire to have children.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two families met but decided not to try to have the girls reunited with their biological parents, and they did not remain in touch after their initial meetings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t see my biological daughter anymore,” Sophie Serrano told Nice-Matin. “The social, educational and cultural differences (between the two families), added to the pain of our unconscious rivalry, took their toll on our relations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she said that she “instinctively loved her biological daughter” from the moment she met her and that although she officially only has three children, “in my heart I have four”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The families pressed charges against the clinic when they first learned of the error but the case was dismissed as the incident had happened a decade beforehand and came under the statute of limitations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now they are seeking compensation in a civil suit which came to court in December last year. They sued the clinic, the doctors who supervised the births, and the auxiliary nurse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cannes clinic had admitted fault - it blames the baby exchange on the nursing auxiliary who it said suffered from alcoholism - but says it will not pay any damages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If it happened to us, it may have happened to others,\" Sophie Serrano said after December's hearing, holding the hand of her non-biological daughter Manon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There should be exemplary sentences.... We really hope to get this recognition, so as to free us from all this guilt about not having been able to protect your kid, not having insisted when we saw there was a problem.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For her part, Manon said she was shocked over accusations levelled in court blaming the mothers for not having recognized their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She protested, she found herself in front of a qualified nurse, she was very young, she had just had a child, so putting the blame on her is absurd, I find that inhuman,\" she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The clinic involved in the mix-up was ordered to compensate both girls - now women - their parents and siblings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both babies had been treated in the same incubator and were then given to the wrong parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the error was discovered 10 years ago, neither family has wanted to swap the girls back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, the court in Grasse, southern France, ordered the clinic in Cannes to pay €400,000 to each of the girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three parents concerned were awarded €300,000 and the clinic must pay €60,000 each to three siblings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The figure awarded was less than one-sixth of the €12m the families had sought, but one of their lawyers said they would not appeal.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another newborn girl was also in the incubator and an auxiliary nurse unwittingly switched them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although both mothers expressed doubts at the time about their babies, because of their different skin tone and hair length, they were sent home anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ten years later, still plagued by doubts, Ms Serrano and her husband had tests which proved neither of them was the biological parent of their daughter, Manon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After an investigation, the two families made contact with each other and eventually took the case to court, but there was never any question of reversing the swap.

National Nuclear Security Administration/Nevada Site Office; Wikipedia (public domain) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its quest for Cold War military superiority, the United States detonated more than 1,000 nuclear weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Government researchers blew up many of the bombs on the ground and others in ocean atolls. Yet as threats moved into space and concerns increased about fallout — soil and other material that's sucked into a blast and becomes radioactive — the US exploded 210 of the terrifying devices high in the atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thousands of films of such blasts, made from 1945 through 1962, were analyzed and locked away in high-security vaults. It's likely no one has seen the footage for decades.

For each film, Spriggs has to fill out a form that then goes over to the Department of Energy for approval.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perrineau, who has appeared in Jennifer Lawrence’s “Passengers” and is the daughter of “Lost” actor Harold Perrineau, told TheWrap she filed a report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TheWrap obtained the results of a polygraph test Perrineau said she passed in September in which she detailed her accusations against Murray, who was also a producer on the Fox animated comedies “King of the Hill” and “American Dad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also Read: Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein, Miramax Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Charging RICO Violation (Exclusive) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miller’s attorney, Matthew Walerstein, said he “categorically and vehemently denies Ms. Perrineau’s outrageous claims” and said his legal team had “gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actress told The Wrap: “I filed a police report today. I cannot talk about the investigation that is happening currently.” She declined further comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said in her statement for the polygraph test that she met Miller while out with some friends at the Standard Hotel, where she “consumed some alcoholic beverages.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was flirting with me. I told him repeatedly that I was 17 years old,” Perrineau said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actress was with two friends, she said, and Miller asked one of them for a ride home “because he was drunk,” and the group agreed. Miller was 35 at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said everyone got out of the car at Miller’s home, and she did not want to, but “felt like I had to go along with everyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At some point, I woke up in Murray’s bed naked. He was on top of me having sexual intercourse with me. At no time did I consent to any sexual contact with Murray,” she said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A West Hollywood Sheriff’s office spokesman confirmed the office took the report Friday and said it would be referred to the LAPD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walerstein’s full statement to TheWrap reads: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After being contacted several weeks ago by lawyers who–on Ms. Perrineau’s behalf–sought substantial monetary damages from him, Mr. Miller’s legal team gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims. Only after her demands for money were rebuffed did Ms. Perrineau go to the police. Mr. Miller looks forward to sharing all evidence and information with any and all authorities seeking the truth in this matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aurora’s mother Brittany Perrieau vehemently denied anyone from her legal team or family asked for monetary damages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At no time have we ever asked Murray Miller for one dollar. There was never a demand for money ever made from anyone on behalf of Aurora or our family,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perrineau’s credits include Lionsgate’s “Jem and the Holograms” feature, the Kristen Stewart indie “Equals” and is in the upcoming Blumhouse horror film “Truth or Dare.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her father Harold is a prolific actor of stage and screen, including the seminal HBO drama “Oz,” “Sons of Anarchy” and films like “The Matrix.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lena Dunham’s “Girls” has been widely celebrated for its gutsy, brutally honest portrayal of millennial life, and has sparked conversations around many issues, including consent. In 2016, Murray and other writers for the show told Vulture what they learned from working on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The first ten years I spent writing for TV, I followed a typical two- or three-act structure. It was remarkable to get on ‘Girls’ and remember, ‘Oh, there are no rules for writing.’ Just like there’s no rules for life. Other than laws.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Report – Perrineau 2 by Sharon Waxman on Scribd ||||| Lena Dunham faced heavy criticism on Twitter Friday night after she came to the defense of Girls writer Murray Miller, whom actress Aurora Perrineau alleged sexually assaulted her in 2012 when she was only 17. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Girls creator and star had released a statement earlier in the evening alongside series co-creator Jenni Konner, in which they voiced their support for Miller and insinuated that Perrineau “misreported” the rape.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While our first instinct is to listen to every woman’s story, our insider knowledge of Murray’s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year,” the pair said in the statement. “It is a true shame to add to that number, as outside of Hollywood women still struggle to be believed. We stand by Murray and this is all we’ll be saying about this issue.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emma McIntyre/Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dunham continued on Twitter: “I believe in a lot of things but the first tenet of my politics is to hold up the people who have held me up, who have filled my world with love.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics of Dunham lashed out at the Golden Globe winner and outspoken feminist, many calling back to a tweet of hers in August when she made the claim that women don’t lie about rape. “‘Believe women, unless they say something about a friend of mine, in which case they are liars,’ ” one user wrote.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Never call yourself an advocate for women again because you’ve just proven that you are NOT,” another critic said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reps for Dunham, Miller and Perrineau did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

At an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi a group of ex-military contractors are providing security. In the aftermath of Gaddafi's downfall a power vacuum exists and the climate is volatile. Military weapons are freely available. The US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, makes a visit to the area, staying in a compound near the CIA base. On the night of 11 September, 2012, the Ambassador's compound is attacked by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican candidate rented out a Des Moines movie theater for a Friday night showing of “13 Hours,” the Benghazi movie highly praised by Hillary Clinton critics, and invited his fans to swing by for a free flick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Trump would like all Americans to know the truth about what happened at Benghazi,” Trump’s Iowa co-chair, Tana Goertz, told the Des Moines Register.

But the contact number she tweeted — 515-267-9191 — rang for minutes without answer Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The phone number listed for the nine-screen theater also rang busy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR '13 Hours' depicts the 2012 terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. (Paramount Pictures) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's unclear if Trump will attend the film with his fans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the multiplex’s website, “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi” usually plays at 6:55 p.m. It’s unclear if the Trump-backed showing begins at 6 or 6:55. Primetime tickets usually cost $7.75. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film depicts the 2012 terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Then-Secretary of State Clinton took responsibility for the security lapses that led to the attack — and her critics have continually brought up the incident while attacking her presidential bid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During a marathon 11-hour session last year, Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi and defended her role in responding to the deadly attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While some conservatives have touted the film as an embarrassment to Clinton, the movie’s creators, including director Michael Bay, maintained it has no political agenda.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We didn’t want it to be turned into a political story about what happened before or what happened after, either from the right’s point of view or the left’s point of view,” said Mark (Oz) Geist, an ex-Marine who’s portrayed in the movie by Max Martini.

(SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the movie is “as apolitical as you can expect,” it still serves as a rallying cry for conservatives, said Christian Toto, a conservative film critic editor of HollywoodInToto.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think you can make an apolitical movie and then have other people use it as they wish,” he said. “This is a subject that has been on conservatives’ minds for a long time … and that’s going to energize them.” ||||| Michael Bay’s “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi” does not contain any mention of Hillary Clinton. Also not named is President Obama. At times, the movie even goes out of its way to avoid politics, as the director has said that he has no political agenda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But any movie about Benghazi is bound to still get caught up in the political fray, particularly one that is being released just weeks before voters caucus in Iowa in the official kickoff of the presidential race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative media for weeks has been abuzz about how the movie may impact Clinton’s presidential hopes, even as her campaign has so far avoided comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly previewed the movie on “The Kelly File” and interviewed three of the CIA contractors at the center of the movie. Kelly introduced the segment as the “gripping new film that may pose a threat to Hillary Clinton’s hopes for the White House.” She then showed footage from the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sean Hannity interviewed three of the contractors, Mark “Oz” Geist, Kris “Tanto” Paronto and John “Tig” Tiegen, on his radio show and Fox News program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movie focuses on the team of security contractors housed at a secret CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, and how they put their lives on the line to respond to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the nearby consulate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related After Megyn Kelly, Madison Avenue Expects a More Traditional 'Today' Megyn Kelly, NBC in Exit Talks NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed, but the events of that evening almost immediately became a lightning rod in the presidential election that year. That has continued into the most recent campaign, in GOP attacks on Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, and on Capitol Hill, where a special Benghazi committee queried her in an October hearing that stretched to almost 11 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the National Review, Stephen Miller wrote that Bay’s “straightforward portrayal of the attack will be as close as pop culture comes to analyzing the failures of the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton that night. Still, the fact that there is any reminder of Benghazi in our popular culture at all is doubtless giving the Clinton campaign major headaches.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Media Matters for America, the watchdog group that has been critical of Fox News reporting, already has countered the way that the network has covered the movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Interviewing three of the former CIA contractors about the movie based on their book, Kelly sought to revive long-debunked myths about the Obama administration’s efforts to respond to the attack,” Media Matters said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paramount premiered the movie in Dallas on Tuesday night at a benefit for veterans in AT&T Stadium and to honor the contractors and those who died in the attacks. Bay told one reporter that the city was “a great place to show it because it is the heartland of America.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a powerful movie, and hopefully this gets the word out,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore told Variety that they expected about 12,000 to 15,000 people to show up for the event; as it turned out, 32,000 did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moore said that what particularly intrigued them was “this amazing story that was getting lost in the politics.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The fact of the matter is the word ‘Benghazi’ has been so connected to political debate that you can’t avoid the politics,” Moore said. “Our hope is that when people see the movie, it turns into a conversation about the heroism of these guys, about how some people lay down their lives to save others. “ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The studio has aimed the movie at military- and faith-based communities, and the real-life contractors have made multiple appearances in conservative media. Cinemark, which has a big footprint in the South, is hosting pre-release screenings in more than 100 theaters on Thursday, with Bay, producer Erwin Stoff and real life contractors Geist, Paronto and Tiegen appearing in a Los Angeles Q&A live streamed to other theaters after the screening. “We are embracing the people who we really believe connect with this material,” Moore said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the movie is debuting on the cusp of a presidential primary, Paramount actually is following the same time frame of recent movies that have captured military and national security sacrifice in the Middle East, including “American Sniper” last year, “Lone Survivor” in 2014 and “Zero Dark Thirty” in 2013, all of which debuted in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moore said that the release date was a function of Bay’s production schedule as well as the three-day holiday weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If this movie came out closer to the general election, that is when this movie would become a political lightning rod,” Moore said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bay’s film is based on “13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,” which was written by Mitchell Zuckoff and the security team, prefaced by a note about how they are avoiding the “political storm” and instead want to tell “what they did, what they saw, and what happened to them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book and the movie do not avoid what has been a point of contention. As the consulate is under siege and Stevens and security personnel call for help, the security contractors at the annex are told by the CIA chief there to “stand down” and wait, causing a delay in response of about 20 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That “stand down” order has been among the most controversial aspects of the Benghazi story. In the book and the movie, the CIA chief tells them to wait, as he seeks out a local militia to respond to the siege. As the situation gets more dire, the contractors buck the “stand down” order and leave for the consulate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional investigators concluded there was no stand down order — even if there was confusion — but the contractors insist those words were used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That moment has been for years the source of criticism from the right, the implication being that the “stand down” order came from higher up in the Obama administration and that calls for help were ignored. The movie does not delve into that claim. Tiegen told Hannity last week that he did not think that the order came “from above.” “I honestly don’t,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movie does show how security at the consulate was insufficient and requests for additional measures were denied. The movie ends with a postscript of what happened to Libya, that it descended into a failed state and a haven for ISIS, points that have been brought up in Democratic and Republican debates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the question of the U.S. involvement in Libya is also left to the viewer to decide. The movie opens with a recap of the U.S. assistance that help depose longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, killed in October 2011, but toward the end of the movie, one of the contractors asks why they are there. Before the fateful attacks, Stevens is shown giving an impassioned if naive speech on America’s humanitarian goals for Libya, while one of the contractors, Paronto nods off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo: The premiere of “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” at the AT& T Center in Dallas on Tuesday. ||||| Our writer-at-large ventures out to his local multiplex and finds out that Bay’s Benghazi spectacular is far from the perfect date film but does sum up a particular slice of the American psyche NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toward the end of last night’s 523rd Republican presidential debate, Senator Ted Cruz, whom you might remember as the demonic spirit from the movie It Follows, suddenly turned into the Moviefone guy and reminded America that a very, very important motion picture is set for release on Friday. “Tomorrow morning a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi,” he said. “And the politicians that abandoned them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was referring to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which you might know better as “The Benghazi Movie”. I honestly haven’t heard many people actually refer to the film by its official title. Ask someone on the street if they’ve seen 13 Hours and they might respond with: “Oh, you mean the Spike Lee movie?” No, that’s the 25th Hour. “Is that the movie about the Cuban missile crisis?” Negative, that’s Thirteen Days. So, I just call it The Benghazi Movie. Sorta like The Lego Movie, but replacing Batman, Lord Business and Wyldstyle with a series of sitcom actors wearing identical beards and some sheep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi review – Michael Bay plays politico for the Fox News crowd Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senator Cruz is still pretty hung up on the events of 11 September 2012, an assault on American diplomatic and espionage bases in Libya. To be fair, so was everyone else on the stage last night. Chris Christie promised that Hillary Clinton, secretary of state during the Benghazi attack, would “not get within 10 miles of the White House” because of her perceived crimes were he to become president. That seems kind of harsh. After all, she used to live there. What if she left her sunglasses in the Lincoln bedroom? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that pointed rhetoric is indicative of the conservative view of Clinton and the tragedy in Benghazi. They want someone punished, preferably Hillary, since she’s actively running for the highest office in the land. Four Americans died, plus those who lost their lives on the other side of the conflict. The people who survived the siege of the American outposts had their very existence changed irrevocably. No one should have to experience such a horror show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except you can right now, for a price. It only cost me $14, plus the cost of two Uber rides, to experience said horror show – well, at least Michael Bay’s multimillion-dollar fictionalized, shaky-cam approximation of a horror show. After Ted Cruz’s call to arms, I knew that it was my duty as an American to swallow a bucket of popcorn like a baby bird while watching the truth about Benghazi’s heroes on the largest screen available. I needed to join my fellow patriots and do my duty. Plus, I had no other plans and no one was answering my phone calls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was seeing the film at the Americana at Brand, an outdoor mall-slash-consumerist pleasure palace that resembles a quaint, small-town American main street. There’s a trolley that ferries shoppers from one end of the mall to the other, which takes much longer than just walking. I suppose it’s great for tourists who want to take pictures. “Look, honey,” they might say. “There’s the Apple store! And a Cheesecake Factory! And a Sephora! Wow, this really is the greatest country in the world.” In that moment, as I take in the capitalist splendor, I feel grateful that I was seeing 13 Hours at the Americana. It reminds me what our boys in Libya were fighting for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I needed to join my fellow patriots and do my duty. Plus, I had no other plans and no one was answering my phone calls NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mall has a theater – a generic monstrosity called the Pacific Theaters 18 – in the middle of the complex. I walk in a half-hour before the 9.05pm screening is set to begin. The clerk at the front of the house asks me to pick my seat – LA is civilized, so most multiplexes have assigned seating now. I have a litany of options, as the theater is maybe 30% full, if I’m being generous. I deliberately choose a seat close to the screen, because if I’m going to get the truth about Benghazi, I want the whole truth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As I enter the auditorium, I scan the crowd for the purposes of assessing the demographics. There’s only one woman I can see, and she’s on a date. I wonder what kind of sadistic creature considered 13 Hours an acceptable date movie. It’s not quite Love, Actually, people. It’s more like Death, Eventually – a grisly, jingoistic tale of noble beards fighting for survival. I suppose that’s kind of romantic. John Krasinski’s character has a wife and children (with another one on the way) that motivate him to survive certain peril at the hands of cruel, nihilistic terrorists. Maybe Ted Cruz will take his wife to see this on Valentine’s Day and declare that he would also gladly eviscerate another human being to see her face again. Hold me, I’m swooning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All thoughts of romance leave me once the lights dim and the ominous music kicks in. This film is very dumb, very bleak and very graphic. I laugh when the squirrelly guy from Breaking Bad screams: “I don’t want to hear it, Tyrone,” as though he’s the surly chief from a bad 80s cop movie. Toward the middle of the picture, Toby Stephens – the English actor best known as the villain from James Bond movie Die Another Day – turns to camera with a straight face and requests “a bag full of money and a flight to Benghazi”, which is the kind of thing that only sounds clever and significant in hindsight. I guarantee you, no one knew that the word “Benghazi” would matter one bit to Americans back home almost four years later. Still, Stephens delivers the line as though he’s talking to an audience in 2016 rather than the character he’s sharing the scene with in the imaginary version of 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a bit of banter and some exposition, the violence begins. One of the lead beards gets his arm shot in half and spends a good portion of the third act with his forearm and hand dangling from the rest of his body like a sausage hanging in a deli window. Bay is sure to frame the broken arm for maximum viewing disruption. It’s so hideous – what with the dripping blood and exposed bones and what not – that you can’t help but pay rapt attention, albeit through the spaces between your fingers as you shield your face from the simulated mutilation. I can’t help but wonder if the couple who came to see this film are regretting their decision as much as I am. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dawn breaks and the cavalry arrives to save our heroes, and the film wraps up with our remaining beards escaping the hellish war zone and returning to their families. Nicky Sobotka from The Wire asks John Krasinski what they get for their trouble. Krasinski says: “We get to go home.” In that moment, I felt like he was speaking for me. Granted, I just watched the movie. I didn’t even act in it. I certainly didn’t live it. All the same, I took great comfort in knowing I was about to go home too. Just like John Krasinski, I was about to see my long-suffering, lonely wife. I just hoped she wasn’t also pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The brave souls who ventured to the outdoor mall in order to watch a fake version of a real war exit the theater peacefully. Hardly anyone speaks to each other, presumably because of the sheer gravity of the art they’ve witnessed, or maybe just because they’re really, really exhausted at midnight on a Thursday. The lone couple makes some small talk, none of it about the movie, from what I can tell. Two men walk out in front of me. They’re also whispering, but I can definitely make out one of them saying the word “crap”. I don’t know if that’s in reference to 13 Hours, the current state of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, or just life in general. Some mysteries should never be solved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My Uber driver on the ride home is named Lavrent. He speaks with an accent, but I don’t dare speculate on its origin for fear of mislabeling him. “Pretty cold out,” Lavrent says in an attempt to make small talk. “Yup, though it could be worse. It could be snowing,” I respond. He goes on to tell me how he once witnessed 20 minutes of snow in Burbank, a town not far from Glendale. His obligatory anecdote complete, we sit in silence for a bit until I venture to ask him how his night is going so far. “I just started,” he tells me. My question is nothing more than a clever way to ask him what he thinks about 13 Hours. “That’s cool. I just saw the Benghazi movie,” I say. From there he shuts down, like I just pressed a button on Data from Star Trek’s neck and deactivated him. “Yeah, it was really bad. I don’t know why I bothered seeing it,” I continue, hoping he’ll have an opinion or really any response at all. Nothing. I realize then that I either offended him or made him think I was about to commit a hate crime. We get to my apartment, I thank him, he mumbles, and I leave. I rate him five stars to apologize for our awkward moment – a minor penance for my social faux pas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s clear to me that collectively, and individually, we don’t want to talk about Benghazi. Granted, neither did Hillary Clinton, but she did, for hours, more than once, with cameras trained on her the entire time. Hillary probably doesn’t want to talk about it because it’s a roadblock in front of her path to the presidency. The average citizen might not want to talk about it because it’s a divisive, politically charged topic with a tinge of xenophobia on the side. Conservatives badly want to talk about it, though, because it’s politically advantageous for them in a presidential election year. In all cases, our response to Benghazi is self-interested, predicated on our political leanings and our tolerance for tragedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right or wrong, I don’t think most Americans understand or care about Benghazi. The rest have moved on. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from November of last year found that only 38% of Americans found Hillary Clinton’s response to the Benghazi attack unsatisfactory. That it is still a throbbing, raw nerve in the gladitorial pit of our democracy is surprising. That it’s now a form of escapist entertainment is depressing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m sure the intention of Michael Bay and the other film-makers behind 13 Hours was to honor the fallen of Benghazi, but at least with the audience I saw the film with, the end result is a mind-numbing sensory assault that’s barely coherent. It’s a movie that’s no more political than a Transformers sequel, probably because Michael Bay is less interested in politics than he is in social hierarchies and class warfare. Like in any Michael Bay movie, bureaucrats, intellectuals and upper-class snobs are benign, arrogant foils for the true heroes – the muscle-bound oaf or the horny teen. If that’s a political statement, then I guess Caddyshack belongs in the same Netflix category as Bowling for Columbine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, Ted Cruz and his fellow candidates will surely try to use this motion picture for their own personal gain for as long as possible. That’s what we do with tragedy in this country, after all. We build a memorial, complete with a gift shop stocked with all the cheaply made junk imaginable. We crank out corny movies based on the true story in the hope that enough people will drag their significant other to the theater to experience the sadness first-hand, with the explicit goal of making a sorry buck off the misery. And we try to score political points whenever possible. That’s the American Way."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics jumped on Dorsey for supporting Chick-fil-A during the month of June, which is Pride Month for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chick-fil-A came under fire from gay rights supporters in 2012 because of comments made by the fast food chicken chain’s CEO, Dan Cathay, expressing opposition to same-sex marriage. The company had also donated millions to anti-gay groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy spurred angry protests at stores by activists as well as supporters who came to rally behind the the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey's tweet reignited the debate. The backlash included comments like: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Wow, I thought better of you @jack Way to support a homophobic company during Pride month.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Did your meal come with a side-order of homophonic bigotry or did you pay extra for it?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FACES OF PRIDE: Memebers of the LGBTQ community and their allies sound off from all 50 states NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey acknowledged the situation after former CNN host Soledad O’Brien tweeted :\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey responded in a tweet: “You’re right. Completley forgot about their background.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all the responses were negative as some on social media rushed to support Dorsey and Chick-fil-A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t let politics dictate my food choices. The LGBTQ community is free to make equally tasty and “hate-free” chicken.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is getting a very public reminding that Chick-fil-A is not an LGBT-supportive company — though he’s far from the only one who has forgotten. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the crowds at your local Chick-fil-A are any indication, much of the United States, even in progressive cities and on college campuses, has forgotten that management of the restaurant chain is opposed to marriage equality and has kept right on giving money to anti-LGBT causes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey forgot that when he posted this tweet: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reaction was quick: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack https://t.co/Wmhq6Obrp1 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) June 10, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey issued his regrets: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey is far from the first to forget about that background. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None other than BuzzFeed posted a fawning story in October headlined \"15 Facts About Chick-fil-A That'll Make You Say, 'Woah, That's Crazy,” and it never mentioned its anti-LGBT history. The piece just talked about how delicious everything tastes. Even Democrats have sometimes forgotten, as evidenced during a sit-in for gun control in 2016, when they ordered out for Chick-fil-A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aside from its record of questionable donations via its foundation, Chick-fil-A also scores a zero on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Although it has some vocal queer defenders, the company has taken no action that would show it welcomes LGBT customers — not a commercial, not a Pride proclamation, nothing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, ThinkProgress reported on Chick-fil-A’s most recent financial disclosures that showed it was still giving in 2015 to anti-LGBT causes. That’s two years after CEO Dan Cathy swore he would stop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mix of donations changed, with money going to less overtly anti-LGBT groups. But the theme remains. ThinkProgress noted $1 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which has a “sexual purity” policy that bans “homosexual acts.” Another $200,000 went to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, which teaches boys that abuse they faced as children “has produced all kinds of evil throughout the culture to include the explosion of homosexuality in the last century.” The Salvation Army got $130,000 — and yes, it’s still openly opposed to marriage equality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The restaurant chain was recently in the news again because Scott Pruitt, the anti-LGBT head of the Environmental Protection Agency, tried (and failed) to win a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. He praised the company as a “franchise of faith.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words, the right wing has not forgotten what Chick-fil-A stands for. Just the opposite. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Huckabee once hosted a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in response to the backlash over its anti-LGBT donations. Now conservatives enjoy ordering Chick-fil-A just to show allegiance. They eat it so often that Sen. Lisa Murkowski once complained it was getting a little tedious to attend meetings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With this latest incident, the use of Chick-fil-A as symbology for social conservatism continues. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped into the Twitter debate to claim the left has gone too far with its dislike for Chick-fil-A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least one famous Twitter user gets the sense that Republicans use Chick-fil-A as a political football. ||||| Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash after eating at Chick-fil-A. Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash online after revealing that he ate at Chick-fil-A this month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Dorsey posted a photo on Twitter with the caption \"Boost @ChickfilA,\" showing he had saved 10% on a $31.58 order at the fast-food chain. A \"boost\" is a cashback reward Square users can earn when using a Cash Card, which is a debit card from the payment platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics immediately seized on Dorsey's support of Chick-fil-A — whose CEO has come under fire for his views on same-sex marriage in the past — during Pride Month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter/@jack NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You must love the taste of bigotry!\" one person wrote in response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth?\" another person wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the critics was the former CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien, who said, \"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorsey responded: \"You're right. Completely forgot about their background.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter/@jack NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people supported Dorsey's decision to eat at Chick-fil-A, saying that it's \"great\" and that he shouldn't have to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One person tweeted: \"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The backlash shows Chick-fil-A still has lingering problems with its brand image following remarks six years ago by the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, regarding his views on same-sex marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cathy set off a fury among gay-rights supporters in 2012 that led to nationwide protests after he told the Baptist Press that the company was \"guilty as charged\" for backing \"the biblical definition of the family unit.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reports soon emerged detailing Chick-fil-A's many charitable donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For months afterward, protesters rallied outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country and held \"kiss-ins,\" where same-sex couples kissed in front of onlookers and TV cameras covering the backlash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then, Chick-fil-A has worked to shed its controversial image, and over time, protests against the chain have largely dissipated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given the backlash against Dorsey's Chick-fil-A meal, however, it seems the fast-food chain still has some work to do to move past Cathy's comments."}
{"context": "PRETORIA, South Africa — It came down to a question of improbabilities and a “great leap.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the fourth day of relentless cross-examination at his murder trial, Oscar Pistorius was taken back to the early hours of Feb. 14, 2013, when he shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, 29, in what the prosecution says was an act of premeditated murder and the track star Mr. Pistorius, a double amputee, says was a mistake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In close detail, the prosecutor, Gerrie Nel, had Mr. Pistorius, 27, relive the final intimate moments of Ms. Steenkamp’s life, as the athlete walked unsteadily on his stumps down an unlit passage from his darkened bedroom, a pistol in his right hand, and into a bathroom where he fired four rounds at the locked door of a toilet cubicle, believing, by his account, that at least one intruder was behind the door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, Mr. Pistorius said, “I ran down the passage; I ran past my bed” to look for his girlfriend and call for help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When I realized that Reeva wasn’t on the bed, that was the first time I thought it might be Reeva in the bathroom,” Mr. Pistorius said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, Mr. Nel said, the “first thing you would think is that you would check whether she left through the bedroom door” rather than assume she had been in the locked cubicle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It required a “great leap” for Mr. Pistorius to go from believing that he had shot intruders to suspecting that he had opened fire on his girlfriend, said Mr. Nel, whose reputation as a pugnacious prosecutor has earned him the nickname pit bull. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You see, Mr. Pistorius, this is one of the most crucial issues that makes your version so improbable,” Mr. Nel said, seeking to establish that the athlete’s evidence on the stand was, in the prosecutor’s words on Monday, “so improbable that it cannot possibly be true.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exchanges went to the core of a case that has drawn a global audience and transfixed many in South Africa as the hearings, which opened on March 3, focus in ever greater detail on the state of Mr. Pistorius’s mind in the early hours on Valentine’s Day 2013, when, the prosecution maintains, he killed Ms. Steenkamp in a jealous rage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spectacle of the trial also offered a stark counterpoint to the days of 2012 when Mr. Pistorius, a double amputee since infancy, not only triumphed at the Paralympic Games but also competed against able-bodied athletes at the London Olympics a month earlier, earning great adulation. On his return home, he and Ms. Steenkamp, a model and law graduate, were depicted as a gilded couple. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that glittery trajectory of success and celebrity has collapsed. Headlines that once lauded Mr. Pistorius now focus on his increasing discomfort as a hard-nosed prosecutor sets out to paint a picture of inconsistency, improbability and mendacity. If convicted of premeditated murder, he would face a minimum prison term of 25 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twice during Monday’s questioning, Mr. Pistorius broke down, as he has several times in the trial, his shoulders heaving as he sobbed. On other occasions, his voice quavered as he testified and, ashen-faced, he seemed on the brink of tears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his displays of deepening distress drew only a sarcastic question from Mr. Nel, who asked, “You are not using your emotional state as an escape, are you?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor argued that forensic evidence linking the gunshots and Ms. Steenkamp’s wounds proved she had been standing in the cubicle facing the door when Mr. Pistorius opened fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She was talking to you,” Mr. Nel said. “Why would she be there except if she was talking to you?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Continue reading the main story Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Pistorius said repeatedly that he had not known who was in the cubicle. “I didn’t fire to attack,” he said. “I didn’t have time to think.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You fired at Reeva,” Mr. Nel said bluntly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I did not fire at Reeva,” Mr. Pistorius said in a choked, strained voice, seeming overwhelmed. The court adjourned briefly to permit him to compose himself. But when the session resumed, Mr. Nel’s insistent questions did, too, despite objections from the defense that the prosecutor was repeatedly going over old ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why had Mr. Pistorius not warned the intruders that he was armed, he asked. “You were armed but you never said you were armed,” Mr. Nel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Pistorius replied that he had not wanted them to know. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why, then, had he fired, Mr. Nel asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Pistorius said he had heard a sound like “wood moving,” perhaps when a door was opened or a magazine rack inside the cubicle was moved. “I wasn’t thinking,” he said. “I was screaming to the person or persons to get out.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You never gave them the chance,” Mr. Nel responded. “You said to them to get out, then never gave them the chance to do it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I fired in quick succession,” Mr. Pistorius said. “I discharged my firearm as quickly as I could.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So “why did you only fire four rounds?” Mr. Nel asked. “Why not empty the magazine?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was it just by luck, then, that the gun was pointed at Ms. Steenkamp, Mr. Nel asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “How could that be lucky?” Mr. Pistorius asked, choking up. “She lost her life.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Pistorius, you are trying to get emotional again,” Mr. Nel said, suggesting that the court adjourn for lunch. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The double-amputee Olympian made the comments during another day of intense cross-examination by prosecutor Gerrie Nel, who has been trying to pick holes in Pistorius' defense since last week. Pistorius, 27, is accused of premeditated murder but insists that he killed the model and law graduate after mistaking her for an intruder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sprinter said he and Steenkamp ate after 7 p.m. on Feb. 13 last year. Early the following morning, Pistorius fired four hollow-point bullets through a bathroom door at his luxury home. Steenkamp died almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nel said expert evidence showed Steenkamp's stomach should have been empty by the time she was killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I put it to you that she must have eaten two hours before her death,\" Nel said. He asked Pistorius if he had any explanation for this.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm putting it to you that she must have eaten two hours before her death.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nel also questioned the athlete on the placement of Steenkamp's clothes in the bedroom. The prosecutor alleged that her jeans and flip-flops were out of place because the pair had an argument and she wanted to leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The denims are inside out,\" Pistorius answered. \"So it would make sense that is when she took them off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nel also attempted to get the athlete to trip up over details previously given to the court and to police following his arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Remember, the theme for the day is [that you have been] tailoring your evidence,\" Nel told Pistorius, repeating a phrase the prosecutor used last week.

He said he used a \"lowered tone\" but did not whisper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nel returned to Pistorius' evidence in chief, a statement given to officers in a cell following his arrest, in which he said that he did in fact whisper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I must have made a mistake by saying 'whispered,' I meant in a low tone,\" he said.

{"context": "Couple's gold discovery will be taxed at top federal rate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Gold Country couple who unearthed at least $10 million worth of 19th century gold coins in their yard last year will probably owe close to half of that sum in federal and state income tax - whether or not they sell the coins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no question that the discovery of the coins is a taxable event. In a famous 1969 decision, a U.S. District Court in Ohio ruled that a \"treasure trove\" is taxable the year it is discovered. In that case, Cesarini vs. United States, a couple bought a used piano in 1957 for about $15. In 1964, they found $4,467 in old currency inside it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court ruled that the money constituted ordinary income in 1964, the year in which they had \"undisputed possession\" of the funds. It did not qualify for the lower capital gains tax rate because neither the piano nor the currency were sold or exchanged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its 2013 tax guide, the IRS states, \"If you find and keep property that does not belong to you that has been lost or abandoned (treasure-trove), it is taxable to you at its fair market value in the first year it is your undisputed possession.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple, who have not been publicly identified, found the coins in cans buried in their backyard in February 2013. That means they will owe tax on the estimated value of the coins by April 15 to avoid a penalty and interest, says Leo Martinez, a law professor at UC Hastings College of the Law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the money will be subject to the top federal tax rate of 39.6 percent, which starts at $450,000 in joint taxable income. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In California, the top rate - on joint income over roughly $1 million - is 13.3 percent. Taxpayers generally get a federal deduction for state income tax paid, reducing their effective federal rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That puts the total amount going to state and federal tax at about 47 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple could try to argue that the find should be taxed as a capital gain on the grounds that \"when they bought the property, it was part of the property and part of the acquisition price,\" says Arthur \"Kip\" Dellinger, a CPA with Cooper, Moss, Resnick, Klein & Co. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Capital gains rate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the rate on collectibles - which include gold and coins - is 28 percent. Starting in 2013, high-income taxpayers will owe a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on some or all of their investment income if their modified adjusted gross income exceeds a certain level ($250,000 for joint returns). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dellinger says the capital gains argument would be tough to win, and \"if the government wants to challenge them, the minute they litigate the issue, their names become known.\" To shield their privacy, he suspects, \"They are going to pay the ordinary income tax and be happy with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To calculate this tax, the couple will have to place a value on each coin. This value becomes the couple's cost basis in each coin. When they sell each coin, the difference between the sales price and the cost basis will be treated as a capital gain or loss. If they hold the coins for at least a year, it will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tiburon coin dealer Don Kagin, who has been tapped to sell the collection for the couple, told The Chronicle that about 90 percent will be sold on Amazon.com's Collectibles site, probably in May. The couple plan to keep a few coins. The rest will be sold privatively to collectors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Selling for tax money NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martinez notes that if the couple unload the coins in a fire sale - to raise money to pay taxes before the April 15 deadline - it could depress the price. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dellinger said that if the couple sell the coins one by one over a period of time, the IRS could assert that \"they are holding those coins as inventory,\" and treat any profit as business income, rather than a capital gain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you own 50 acres of real estate and you sell 50 acres in one sale, it's a capital gain. If you subdivide it, and sell 10 parcels, you are considered as holding inventory as a developer,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martinez considers that unlikely. \"I think it's hard to call them dealers,\" he says. \"They are like any other people who find property, and whether they sell it slowly or fast,\" it will be considered a capital gain. ||||| An anonymous couple in California’s “gold country”—named after the 1849 Gold Rush—found $10 million in rare gold coins buried in cans on their property. Why stay anonymous? They don’t want people digging on their property. After all, this is the biggest and best coin discovery in U.S. history. So said Davis Hall of Professional Coin Grading Service which authenticated the find. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Walking their dog as usual, the couple noticed a rusty metal can sticking out of the ground. A little digging revealed over 1,400 rare and perfectly preserved U.S. gold coins dated from 1847 to 1894. Most were minted in nearby San Francisco. In $5, $10 and $20 denominations, they add up to a face value of more than $28,000, but their market value is likely over $10 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It makes them the best treasure find ever. Approximately 90% of the coins will go up on Amazon.com's \"Collectibles\" site, according to Don Kagin, of Kagin's, Inc., who is assisting the anonymous owners. The couple said they plan to keep some of the coins and sell others, donating part of the proceeds to charity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they haven’t said anything about the IRS and the hungry state of California. Will the IRS and the state get a piece? You bet. In tax lingo, this is called “treasure trove,” a term that actually appears in the tax law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is just one example of the astounding breadth of the U.S. concept of what’s income for tax purposes. The most famous case on treasure trove is Cesarini v. United States. Mr. Cesarini bought a used piano for $15 and found nearly $5,000 in cash inside. Imagine his surprise and delight over such good luck! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the IRS said it was taxable income. Mr. Cesarini went to court over it, but the court agreed with the IRS. Mr. Cesarini appealed, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed too. See Cesarini v. United States. But does this mean the gold will be taxed? Unfortunately, yes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Income taxes don’t apply to gifts, but this wasn’t a gift. And there are few other exclusions from income. Perhaps the couple might argue that they lost and later found the gold? After all, if you get something back that was really yours, it generally shouldn’t be income. That tax rule is no help here since this is old gold and clearly predated the couple and their ownership of the land. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That makes it different from art stolen by the Nazis and later recovered. There, if you can prove it’s yours, it’s not taxed. Well, unless you deducted the loss on your taxes. Under the tax benefit rule, if you claimed a tax benefit in the past, you must take the item back into income when you recover it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the bottom line for the gold country couple with the big find? The couple will probably have no choice but to report the value of the gold on their taxes. The rules are the same for California taxes, too. And while they still made an astounding find, taxes can be an unpleasant surprise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazingly, giving to charity to make it even worse, as sometimes happens with prize money. You can decline a prize and avoid all taxes. But if you accept it and then donate it to charity, you can’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tax rules aren’t parallel so you end up paying tax on money you gave away. Even if you immediately give it to charity, you can only deduct charitable contributions up to 50% of your “contribution base”—generally your adjusted gross income. Thus, if you win $1 million and have no other income, you can deduct only half even if you give it all away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The limit is even lower (30%) for gifts to certain private non-operating foundations, veterans organizations, fraternal societies and nonprofit cemeteries. You can carry over excess deductions from one year to the next, and you have five years to use it up. In the meantime, though, you are paying tax on money you’ve given away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that you must take the winnings into income means you also may lose other deductions and personal exemptions. Even if you give all the prize money to charity, you end up paying more taxes than if you had never received the cash. It’s just another example of our terribly complex–and not very forgiving–tax law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for me, I’m off to walk my dog—in the Gold Country.

He said he \"never struggled\" with the issue because \"the state of Texas has a very thoughtful, very clear process in place.\"Buck's guilt is not in doubt. At issue is the sentencing hearing, at which jurors were called upon to decide whether to condemn him to death or to life in prison. Under Texas law, the jury must weigh whether the defendant poses a \"future danger.\"Dr. Walter Quijano, a psychologist and defense witness, testified that Buck was not likely to be dangerous because he had no previous history of violence.But a prosecutor cited the \"the race factor\" and asked whether Buck's being black \"increases the future dangerousness.\" Yes, the psychologist replied. Prosecutors cited that testimony in their closing argument.More than a decade ago, Texas state attorneys admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court that Quijano had wrongly injected race into the sentencing hearings for seven Texas death row inmates, including Buck.\"It is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system,\" then-Texas Atty.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has described the tactics as torture, but insisted that they are necessary to defeat ISIS.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The agencies’ detention and interrogation program, I believe, was instrumental in keeping this country safe in the aftermath of 9/11,” he said. “There were individuals that were subjected to these [enhanced interrogation techniques] that subsequent to that provided information that was in fact credible and worthwhile for pursuit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, Brennan’s support for the past use of enhanced interrogations has become a source of criticism from ardent opponents of the practice.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In April, Brennan told NBC News that the CIA would refuse an order to resume its torture program. But on Wednesday, speaking at a Brookings Institute event, he said he was just speaking on his own behalf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If a president were to order, order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else, it’ll be up to the director of CIA and others within CIA to decide whether or not that, that direction and order is something that they can carry out in good conscience,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that he was personally opposed: “As long as I’m director of CIA, irrespective of what the president says, I’m not going to be the director of CIA who gives that order. They’ll have to find another director.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan did not acknowledge that Congress last year turned Obama’s anti-torture executive order into law, explicitly banning waterboarding and other forms of torture — and restricting the CIA in particular to interrogation methods listed in the Army Field Manual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for a possible expansion of drone strikes, current policy guidelines issued by President Obama in 2013 require “near certainty” on the part of the government “before lethal action is taken,” that “the terrorist target is present,” and that “noncombatants will not be injured or killed.” President Obama called that standard the “highest standard we can set.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When The Intercept asked whether the CIA would abandon the “near certainty” standard if ordered to do so, Brennan said, “Any subsequent president can change” restrictions on drone targeting. “If this president or the next president decides to change existing directing policy guidance, it is the [Central Intelligence] Agency’s responsibility to carry out that direction.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has previously advocated for targeting the innocent family members of terrorist suspects, saying, “When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re chopping off our heads in the Middle East,” Trump said Wednesday. “They want to kill us, they want to kill us. They want to kill our country. They want to knock out our cities.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump speaks with Bill Herbkersman in Bluffton, S.C. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With his comments, Trump has reignited debate over extreme interrogation measures that the CIA embraced after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks but discontinued more than a decade ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waterboarding involves restraining prisoners on their backs with their feet higher than their heads, then covering their faces and pouring water into their mouths and noses, making them feel as though they are drowning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the CIA held more than 100 prisoners in its secret overseas prisons, only three are known to have been subjected to waterboarding. Among them was Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, who was waterboarded 183 times before the agency abandoned the practice amid concerns that its legal footing was slipping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [How the Iraq war is haunting the 2016 presidential contest] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For months, Trump has repeatedly called for the use of waterboarding and other unidentified techniques that are even more severe. Up until Wednesday, Trump had stopped short of calling such techniques torture, although his comments seemed to show him openly embracing the idea of torturing people who are at odds with the United States. Trump’s campaign manager and spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In late November, Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, that he would approve the use of waterboarding “in a heartbeat” because “only a stupid person would say it doesn’t work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If it doesn’t work,” Trump said, “they deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s call for waterboarding and more extreme measures is always met with warm applause and cheers at his rallies — forcing his opponents into a tricky position. The traditional GOP response has been that torture is wrong but that waterboarding is not torture. How do they deal with a rival who embraces waterboarding as being torture and calls for its use? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the staunchest defenders of the CIA program have stopped far short of Trump’s position. In books and television appearances, CIA veterans have maintained that the agency’s methods were legally approved by the Justice Department and never constituted torture. But no prominent former CIA executive has argued that the program should be reinstated, and many believe that even if a future president were to order a resumption of waterboarding or other brutal measures, agency operatives would almost certainly refuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA has maintained that it got valuable intelligence from the program, but it came at a considerable price. Agency operatives remained under a cloud of criminal and congressional investigations for years. A multi-year Senate probe completed in 2014 found that even CIA insiders were at times deeply disturbed by what they witnessed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Fact Checker: Trump’s baseless claim that W.H. tried to ‘silence’ him on Iraq] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CIA medical personnel warned that waterboarding sessions often described to policymakers as a carefully administered procedure had deteriorated to a “series of near drownings.” In 2002, agency employees at a secret prison in Thailand broke down emotionally after watching harrowing interrogations of al-Qaeda suspect Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, better known as Abu Zubaida, “some to the point of tears and choking up.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama banned CIA enhanced interrogations within days of taking office in 2009. Since then, terrorism suspects captured overseas have been questioned by a team including FBI and CIA representatives who are supposed to abide by strict U.S. military interrogation guidelines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire, former Florida governor Jeb Bush — whose brother authorized waterboarding — said that it was “used sparingly” and that he would not take action to revive it. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said waterboarding “does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture” but that he “would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) seemed to avoid answering the question by saying that U.S. officials “should not be discussing in a widespread way the exact tactics that we’re going to use because that allows terrorists to know to practice how to evade us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, at the same event, Trump pledged to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The morning after the debate, ABC’s “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump whether he “would authorize torture.” Trump responded: “I would absolutely authorize something beyond waterboarding.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) — who was tortured as a prisoner during the Vietnam War — said that “waterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques” did not prevent further attacks on the country and “compromised our values, stained our national honor, and did little practical good.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [What Donald Trump was up to while John McCain was a prisoner of war] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the same day, however, Trump mocked Cruz for not taking a stronger stance on waterboarding. As he spoke at a rally, a woman in the audience called Cruz “a pussy” — an insult that Trump repeated to the crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waterboarding came up again Wednesday when South Carolina state Rep. Bill Herbkersman (R) asked Trump a series of questions in a fireside-chat-style event that lasted 33 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “On that whole thing of politically correct, would you allow U.S. interrogators to waterboard terrorist prisoners in order to extract information?” Herbkersman asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Absolutely,” Trump said to strong applause from the audience of about 500 retirees, who often laughed as Trump discussed the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Cruz, Trump said that “he didn’t want to get involved because he thought waterboarding was bad, so — of course it’s bad, but it’s not chopping off heads, folks. Okay? That I can tell you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said that he would “immediately” resume waterboarding and other techniques that are “much worse” because the United States is facing a barbaric enemy. He called waterboarding a “minor form” of interrogation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Some people say it’s not actually torture — let’s assume it is,” Trump said. “But they asked me the question: ‘What are you going to do on waterboarding?’ Absolutely fine, but we should go much stronger than waterboarding. That’s the way I feel.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greg Miller in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who has previously promised to perform \"a lot worse\" than waterboarding on terrorists, is taking a significantly softened stance on torture policies, according to a new Wall Street Journal report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement to the Journal, Trump said he would \"use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies.\" But he continued, \"I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties, and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The position seems to be a reversal of Trump's previous promises to torture terrorists, mentioned just a day ago at Thursday's Republican debate in Detroit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the debate stage, Trump was asked by debate moderator and Fox News host Brett Baier, \"Experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists' families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders. So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump shot back: \"They're not going to refuse. Believe me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Baier pointed out that such policies are \"illegal,\" Trump responded: \"Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They're chopping off heads. They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They're drowning people in steel cages. And he -- now we're talking about waterboarding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What do you think of waterboarding? I said it's fine. And if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger, too,\" he continued. \"Because, frankly that's the way I feel. Can you imagine -- can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That's my opinion.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also doubled back on another policy issue Thursday night, changing his tone on immigration and skilled worker visas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the billionaire had previously stated that increasing the number of skilled immigrant worker visas would destroy American workers, Trump said on the debate stage that he was \"changing it and softening the position\" because \"we need talented people in this country.\" ||||| Just as Donald Trump is about to officially become the Republican presidential nominee at next week's convention in Cleveland, CIA Director John Brennan issued a direct warning to the billionaire: he will not reinstate waterboarding even if the president orders him to do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If a president were to order the agency to carry out waterboarding or something else...I can say as long as I'm director of CIA--irrespective of what the president says--I'm not going to be the director of CIA that gives that order,\" he said at a Wednesday event at the Brookings Institution. \"They will have to find another director.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Director Brennan explicitly avoided using Trump's name in his comments, the presumptive GOP nominee has been criticized for remarks he's made about torture techniques in the past, proclaiming at a presidential debate in New Hampshire that he would \"bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\" an interrogation tactic used to simulate the effects of drowning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know that there have been calls for waterboarding, or worse--whatever else,\" Director Brennan added. \"As long as I'm director of CIA, we are not going to go down that road again.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a backlash from political opponents, military officers and former cabinet members, Trump reversed his position, telling the Wall Street Journal, \"I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was in March. In June, Trump senior adviser Barry Bennett caused more controversy when he mentioned waterboarding in relation to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, referring to her response to the FBI inquiry into the handling of her private email server. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You couldn't get the truth from Hillary Clinton if you waterboarded her,\" Bennett said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the director said there was once a place for \"enhanced interrogation techniques,\" or EITS, particularly in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. At the same time, though, Brennan explained that there is no reliable way to establish cause and effect between the application of these torture techniques and extracting credible information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The agency suffered a great cost because of that program,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan assumed his current position in the CIA in March 2013. Less than a year later, in December 2014, he was left to answer for the use of the techniques during George W. Bush's presidency after the Senate Select Intelligence Committee released a damning review of the agency's earlier practices. President Obama, upon taking office in January 2009, banned the use of EITS, which included other methods, such as sleep deprivation."}

(Russian Defense Ministry/YouTube) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American antitank missiles supplied to Syrian rebels are playing an unexpectedly prominent role in shaping the Syrian battlefield, giving the conflict the semblance of a proxy war between the United States and Russia, despite President Obama’s express desire to avoid one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW missiles were delivered under a two-year-old covert program coordinated between the United States and its allies to help vetted Free Syrian Army groups in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad. Now that Russia has entered the war in support of Assad, they are taking on a greater significance than was originally intended.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebels claim they took out 24 tanks and armored vehicles on the first day, and the toll has risen daily since then. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was a tank massacre,” said Capt. Mustafa Moarati, whose Tajamu al-Izza group says it destroyed seven tanks and armored vehicles Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More missiles are on the way, he said. New supplies arrived after the Russian deployments began, he said, and the rebels’ allies have promised further deliveries soon, bringing echoes of the role played by U.S.-supplied Stinger antiaircraft missiles in forcing the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan in the 1980s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hits also plunged Washington into what amounts to a proxy war of sorts with Moscow, despite Obama’s insistence this month that “we’re not going to make Syria into a proxy war between the United States and Russia.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a proxy war by happenstance,” said Jeff White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who counted at least 15 tanks and vehicles destroyed or disabled in one day. “The rebels happen to have a lot of TOWs in their inventory. The regime happened to attack them with Russian support. I don’t see it as a proxy war by decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether it will become one is one of the key questions confronting the Obama administration in the wake of President Vladimir Putin’s decision to throw Russia’s support behind Assad’s regime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The TOW missile program overseen by the CIA is entirely separate from a failed program run by the Pentagon that was intended to influence the outcome of the other war being waged in Syria, the one in the northeastern part of the country against the Islamic State. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA program got underway before the Pentagon one, in early 2014, with the goal of propping up the flagging rebellion against Assad’s rule by delivering training, small arms, ammunition and the antitank missiles, which have proved instrumental in eroding the government’s key advantage over the lightly armed rebel force — its tanks and heavy armor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supplied mostly from stocks owned by Saudi Arabia, delivered across the Turkish border and stamped with CIA approval, the missiles were intended to fulfill another of the Obama administration’s goals in Syria — Assad’s negotiated exit from power. The plan, as described by administration officials, was to exert sufficient military pressure on Assad’s forces to persuade him to compromise — but not so much that his government would precipitously collapse and leave a dangerous power vacuum in Damascus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, the Russian military intervened to shore up the struggling Syrian army — an outcome that was not intended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A primary driving factor in Russia’s calculus was the realization that the Assad regime was militarily weakening and in danger of losing territory in northwestern Syria. The TOWs played an outsize role in that,” said Oubai Shahbandar, a Dubai-based consultant who used to work with the Syrian opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think even the Americans were surprised at how successful they’ve been,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [The Syrian rebels who received first U.S. missiles of war] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was no accident, say U.S. officials and military analysts, that the first targets of Russian airstrikes in Syria were the locations where the rebels armed with TOW missiles have made the most substantial gains and where they most directly threaten Assad’s hold over his family’s heartland in the coastal province of Latakia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those areas were also where the first offensive since the Russian intervention was launched, with columns of Syrian armored vehicles and tanks setting out from government strongholds into the countryside of the provinces of Hama and Idlib. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What the TOWs have done, White said, is “offset the regime’s advantage in armor. The TOWs have cut away at that edge, and that’s what we’ve seen playing out. It’s like the Stingers in Afghanistan.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is unclear whether the TOWs will be able to change the course of the war, as did the Stinger antiaircraft missiles introduced in the 1980s by the CIA in Afghanistan, where they were used by the mujahideen to shoot down Russian helicopters and paralyze the Soviet army. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now that the Russians have introduced more intensive and heavier airstrikes and, for the first time, combat helicopters have been seen in videos strafing villages in the Hama area, the TOW missiles may only be able to slow, but not block, government advances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebels have appealed for the delivery of Stinger missiles or their equivalents to counter the new threat from the air, but U.S. officials say that is unlikely. The Obama administration has repeatedly vetoed past requests from the rebels, as well as their Turkish and Saudi allies, for the delivery of antiaircraft missiles, out of concerns that they could fall into extremist hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the TOW missile program is already in progress, and all the indications are that it will continue. Saudi Arabia, the chief supplier, has pledged a “military” response to the Russian incursion, and rebel commanders say they have been assured more will arrive imminently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the terms of the program, the missiles are delivered in limited quantities, and the rebel groups must return the used canisters to secure more, to avoid stockpiling or resale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The system appears to have helped prevent the missiles from falling into extremist hands. Robert Ford, who was serving as U.S. envoy to Syria when the program got underway, said he was aware of only two TOWs obtained by the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, while “dozens and dozens” have been fired by moderate groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nusra made a big public display of having these two missiles,” said Ford, who is now a fellow at the Middle East Institute. Had they acquired more, he said, “they would be using them now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The supplies of the missiles, manufactured by Raytheon, are sourced mainly from stocks owned by the Saudi government, which purchased 13,795 of them in 2013, for expected delivery this year, according to Defense Department documents informing Congress of the sale. Because end-user agreements require that the buyer inform the United States of their ultimate destination, U.S. approval is implicit, said Shahbandar, a former Pentagon adviser. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But no decision is required from the Obama administration for the program to continue, Shahbandar said. “It doesn’t need an American green light. A yellow light is enough,” he said. “It’s a covert effort and it’s technically deniable, but that’s what proxy wars are.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syrian forces begin ground offensive backed by Russia air and sea power NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is Russia’s airpower in Syria NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton criticizes ‘failed’ effort to train Syrian rebels ||||| (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday his country's involvement in Syria is helping protect the world.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi was acquitted in March 2016 of four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking involving three complainants. Months later he apologised to a former colleague as part of a deal to drop another count of sexual assault he was facing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an essay published by the New York Review of Books, Ghomeshi maintained that the accusations against him were “inaccurate”. He reflected on a fall from grace that saw him go from one of the country’s best-known broadcasters to what he described as a “poster boy for men who are assholes”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jian Ghomeshi apologizes to former colleague as part of deal to drop charge Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The essay, published online on Friday, is set to be included an upcoming print issue of the magazine, titled The Fall of Men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve become a hashtag,” Ghomeshi wrote. “One of my female friends quips that I should get some kind of public recognition as a #MeToo pioneer. There are lots of guys more hated than me now. But I was the guy everyone hated first.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The accusations against Ghomeshi stunned the country when they burst into public view in 2014. At the time, Ghomeshi was a rising star at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, celebrated for his thoughtful interviews and socially progressive views. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually more than 20 women came forward with allegations of being slapped, punched, bitten, choked or smothered by the radio host. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi denied the accusations, pleading not guilty to four charges of sexual assault and another of choking to overcome resistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The high-profile trial – which took place months before #MeToo snowballed into a global movement – sparked a national conversation on consent and sexual violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi writes that he contemplated suicide after the allegations emerged. His essay, which marks his first comments on the allegations since his acquittal, stops short of offering an apology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Even as I feel deep remorse about how I treated some people in my life, I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate. What I do confess is that I was emotionally thoughtless in the way I treated those I dated and tried to date,” he wrote, describing himself as a creep when it came to his behaviour with women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But it went deeper than that. I was demanding on dates and in personal affairs … I was critical and dismissive.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Claiming that countless men had approached him in the aftermath of the accusations with their own confessions of inappropriate behaviour, Ghomeshi said he had come to view his actions as “part of a systemic culture of unhealthy masculinity”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He acknowledged that the outcome of the trial had left many unhappy. “There was a sentiment among them that, regardless of any legal exoneration, I was almost certainly a world-class prick, probably a sexual bully, and that I needed to be held to account beyond simply losing my career and reputation,” he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His roughly 3,500-word essay also included an admission that a piece focused entirely on his experience “may be seen as not helpful in rendering women’s experiences more visible”.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Jian Ghomeshi gets to write a cover story for the New York Review of Books, but please, tell me more about how men have their careers permanently destroyed when they’re accused of sexual assault,” wrote another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others contrasted the platform given to Ghomeshi with stories of complainants who said they had faced threats or professional repercussions for speaking out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When contacted by the Guardian, the New York Review of Books declined to comment on its decision to publish the piece. ||||| It’s the first time Ghomsehi has spoken out on the aftermath of sexual assault accusations against him that first surfaced in 2014. In the hours after it was posted, the piece drew a chorus of negative reaction on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disgraced CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi has penned a personal essay in the prestigious New York Review of Books, bemoaning that he’s “become a hashtag” and confessing to being “emotionally thoughtless” to women he dated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former CBC radio host was acquitted of sexually assaulting three women in March 2016, following a high-profile criminal trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are lots of guys more hated than me now. But I was the guy everyone hated first,” Ghomeshi writes in “Reflections from a Hashtag ,” which was posted Friday, adding that a female friend quipped to him he “should get some kind of public recognition as a #MeToo pioneer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There was a sentiment among them that, regardless of any legal exoneration, I was almost certainly a world-class prick, probably a sexual bully, and that I needed to be held to account beyond simply losing my career and reputation,” he writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the essay, Ghomeshi writes nearly 3,500 words about his life’s implosion, and how the outcome of his trial left his accusers and many observers deeply unhappy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before MeToo became a hashtag and global movement, Ghomeshi’s trial ignited a national conversation on sexual assault the way its handled by the justice system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An image of the issue’s cover, posted to the magazine’s website , bills his essay as “Jian Ghomeshi on Jian Ghomeshi,” under the header “The Fall of Men.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The illustration for the online version of the essay, which will be published in the Oct. 11 issue of the magazine, is Edvard Munch’s “Evening, Melancholy I,” showing a sad man staring into the distance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crown in court alleged he approached Borel from behind, “held her waist and pressed his pelvis back and forth repeatedly into her buttocks” when they were working late one night in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In May 2016, a further charge of sexual assault against him was withdrawn after Ghomeshi apologized to former CBC colleague Kathryn Borel for “sexually inappropriate behaviour” in the office, and signed a peace bond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CBC fired Ghomeshi from his hosting role on the arts and entertainment program Q in fall 2014 after executives saw a video showing bruising on a woman who had dated him. Ghomeshi responded in a Facebook message insisting everything had been consensual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi’s expresses his remorse for his actions in the piece, but stops short of confessing to any physical abuse, and does not explicitly apologize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Even as I feel deep remorse about how I treated some people in my life, I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate. What I do confess is that I was emotionally thoughtless in the way I treated those I dated and tried to date,” he writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I ought to have been more respectful and responsive with the women in my life. To them I say, you deserved much better from me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farrah Khan, co-ordinator of Ryerson University’s Office of Sexual Violence Support and Education, said it is important to have a conversation about how those accused of sexual violence can be accountable, and what people can do when friends and colleagues are accused — but this isn’t it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Accountability for me would be reaching out to the people that you harmed and being accountable to them,” said Khan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi “admitted to taking celebrity a little bit too far,” but did little more than that, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Khan also took issue with the the “casual” way the magazine released the piece. “Rarely do people who’ve been harmed get this much space,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A staffer who picked up the phone at the New York Review of Books said she was not allowed to comment on the piece, but confirmed it is featured, along with other stories, on the Oct. 11 cover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The magazine did not reply to requests for comment directed at its publicity department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York-based writer Moira Donegan tweeted after the article came out that “It’s becoming bitterly apparent that being a man credibly accused of sexual harassment or assault is one of the more surefire ways for an aspiring writer to find magazine work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, Donegan outed herself as the person behind the “S----y Media Men” list, an anonymously authored Google spreadsheet aimed at alerting women to men accused of sexual harassment and assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added in a direct message to the Star that the Ghomeshi essay and a recent Harper’s Magazine piece by John Hockenberry, another broadcaster accused of sexual misconduct, suggest that “editors’ apparent eagerness to undermine the Me Too movement” shows a “broader problem with a lack of diversity in editorial leadership at legacy magazines — where publishers and editors in chief are still largely white and male.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the piece, Ghomeshi describes how as a rising radio star he was outwardly progressive and “it didn’t occur” to him that he could “ever be one of the bad men,” looking to bolster his self-esteem with external validation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Dating and having sex became another measure of status,” he writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I began to see my own actions as part of a systemic culture of unhealthy masculinity.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lenore Lukasik-Foss, chair of the Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres, described Ghomeshi as “dancing around” the allegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s using a lot of euphemisms that downplay his behaviour, that excuse his behaviours,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He is still trying to hang on to some sort of notion of himself as a guy who was woke.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One the allegations against Ghomeshi centred around choking during sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Canada, Khan noted, has been ahead of the U.S. when it comes to a public discussion of sexual harassment and assault, in part because of the Ghomeshi trial, and is already starting to see a backlash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have not had our year of #MeToo, we have had four years of this conversation,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi lashes out at the media later in the piece, saying he became a “meal ticket for certain reporters who pumped out whatever stories they could with my name in the headline.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also says he faced racism after the allegations went public, and he even contemplated suicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ghomeshi adds that many men approached him in the aftermath to “furtively say, ‘What happened to you could have been me.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the safety of conversations they were certain would not become public, men would tell me there were things that they, too, could have been accused of at points in their lives,” he writes.

Photos by Sonia Recchia/Getty Images for Grey Goose Vodka and the New York Review of Books. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well before the world associated the phrase “me too” with sexual assault, Jian Ghomeshi was a popular Canadian radio host and musician. In 2014 and 2015, however, he became the subject of numerous allegations of sexual assault, which included biting, choking, and punching women in the head. In 2016, he was acquitted on a number of criminal counts when the judge said that the three women who testified in court against him had changed aspects of their story or had failed to reveal information to law enforcement. But these were only a few of the accusations against Ghomeshi, which eventually were made by more than 20 women. He also avoided criminal charges in a separate trial by signing a “peace bond” and apologizing to his victim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, Ghomeshi has published a long essay in the New York Review of Books, titled “Reflections From a Hashtag.” In it, Ghomeshi aims to “inject nuance” into his story and says he has faced “enough humiliation for a lifetime” as a victim of “mass shaming.” He also claims to have learned some lessons that have made him a better man: “I have spent these years trying to listen, read, and reflect,” he writes, adding that he now understands that he could be too demanding on dates. Still, he denies the vast majority of the accusations. The piece is promoted on the cover as part of a package on “The Fall of Men” and lands on the same week that Harper’s published a long first-person essay by John Hockenberry, who last year was accused of harassing several female colleagues at WNYC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I recently spoke by phone with Ian Buruma, the editor of the New York Review of Books, about the decision to publish the Ghomeshi piece, which has already proven controversial. (Full disclosure: I have met Buruma several times, and he offered me a job last year after he took over the NYRB.) During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we discussed the genesis of the piece, the ethics of publishing people who do bad deeds, and why the specific nature of Ghomeshi’s behavior is not really Buruma’s “concern.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Isaac Chotiner: How did this piece come about? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ian Buruma: I met, through another editor, many months ago, Jian Ghomeshi, whom I hadn’t met before and who told me his story and said that he was interested in writing about it. I was interested in the subject, which as we discussed then, the first time I saw him, was what it was like to be, as it were, at the top of the world, doing more or less what you like, being a jerk in many ways, and then finding your life ruined and being a public villain and pilloried. This seemed like a story that was worth hearing—not necessarily as a defense of what he may have done. But it is an angle on an issue that is clearly very important and that I felt had not been exposed very much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was it at a social occasion that you met? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, no, it was a coffee to discuss the prospect of writing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The editor had … I don’t know how he knew Ghomeshi. I have no idea. But the three of us had coffee and his story was discussed and he expressed an interest in writing about it. And I said I find it an interesting story, so I will read whatever you come up with. [Note: When I called Buruma back to ask whether the other editor worked at a different publication—as I had perhaps wrongly assumed from his first answer—he did not answer, telling me, “It’s irrelevant. It’s neither here nor there.”] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Were there in-house objections to the piece? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. We had a proper office discussion and everybody expressed their views and not everybody agreed. But all views were aired and in the end, when the decision was made, the office stuck together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was there a gender breakdown during the discussion? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I would say not necessarily just in this particular case. I would say that on issues to do with #MeToo and relations between men and women and so on, there isn’t so much a gender breakdown as there is a generational one. I think that is generally true. I don’t think our office is in any way unusual. I think people over 40 and under 40 often have disagreements about this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How old are you? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m 66. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are you then on the predictable side of that divide, given what you said? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I wouldn’t want to categorize myself quite so starkly. Like everybody who thinks about these issues, I have ambivalent feelings about it. I have absolutely no doubt that the #MeToo movement is a necessary corrective on male behavior that stands in the way of being able to work on equal terms with women. In that sense, I think it’s an entirely good thing. But like all well-intentioned and good things, there can be undesirable consequences. I think, in a general climate of denunciation, sometimes things happen and people express views that can be disturbing. I wouldn’t say that I have an unequivocal view of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do you think what happened to Ghomeshi is an “undesirable consequence?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think it has undesirable, or at least unresolved, aspects to it. I think nobody has quite figured out what should happen in cases like his, where you have been legally acquitted but you are still judged as undesirable in public opinion, and how far that should go, how long that should last, and whether people should make a comeback or can make a comeback at all—there are no hard and fast rules. That’s an issue we should be thinking about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But— NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hang on. Hang on. The reason I was interested in publishing it is precisely to help people think this sort of thing through. I am not talking about people who broke the law. I am not talking about rapists. I am talking about people who behaved badly sexually, abusing their power in one way or another, and then the question is how should that be sanctioned. Something like rape is a crime, and we know what happens in the case of crimes. There are trials and if you are held to be guilty or convicted and so on, there are rules about that. What is much murkier is when people are not found to have broken the law but have misbehaved in other ways nonetheless. How do you deal with such cases? Should that last forever? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are numerous allegations of sexual assault against Ghomeshi, including punching women in the head. That seems pretty far on the spectrum of bad behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’m no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation. How can I be? All I know is that in a court of law he was acquitted, and there is no proof he committed a crime. The exact nature of his behavior—how much consent was involved—I have no idea, nor is it really my concern. My concern is what happens to somebody who has not been found guilty in any criminal sense but who perhaps deserves social opprobrium, but how long should that last, what form it should take, etc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O. J. Simpson was not found guilty in a criminal trial. I assume, even if he didn’t have other issues, we might have paused before asking him to write an essay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is true, but he was found guilty in a civil trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think even if he hadn’t been is perhaps the point to be made. But let’s also note that Ghomeshi signed a peace bond and avoided another trial by apologizing to a victim. And these allegations were from more than 20 women. We don’t know what happened, I agree. But that is an astonishing number, no? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I am not going to defend his behavior, and I don’t know if what all these women are saying is true. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it isn’t. My interest in running this piece, as I said, is the point of view of somebody who has been pilloried in public opinion and what somebody like that feels about it. It was not run as a piece to exonerate him or to somehow mitigate the nature of his behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You say it’s not your “concern,” but it is your concern. If you knew the allegations were true, I assume you would not have run the piece. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, it depends what the allegations are. What you were saying just now was rather vague. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Punching women against their will. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those are the allegations, but as we both know, sexual behavior is a many-faceted business. Take something like biting. Biting can be an aggressive or even criminal act. It can also be construed differently in different circumstances. I am not a judge of exactly what he did. All I know is that he was acquitted and he is now subject to public opprobrium and is a sort of persona non grata in consequence. The interest in the article for me is what it feels like in that position and what we should think about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his piece, he writes, “In October 2014, I was fired from my job at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after allegations circulated online that I’d been abusive with an ex-girlfriend during sex.” But it was not about online rumors. The Toronto Star, a famed and respected newspaper, was about to publish a big piece, and that is why he resigned, correct? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s a respected newspaper, yes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But you don’t think that’s misleading in any way? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not really, but again, I am not judging him for the exact rights and wrongs of what he did in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I am asking you about what he wrote in your magazine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, I don’t think so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also writes, “In the aftermath of my firing, and amid a media storm, several more people accused me of sexual misconduct.” Is “several” sufficient for more than 20 women? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, in a literal sense, it is. It might have been better to mention the exact number, possibly so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One passage states, “One of the charges was separated and later withdrawn with a peace bond—a pledge to be on good behavior for a year. There was no criminal trial.” He doesn’t mention that he was also forced to apologize, which feels crucial in trying to ascertain his innocence or guilt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I don’t have the piece right in front of me. What exactly did he write? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One of the charges was separated and later withdrawn with a peace bond—a pledge to be on good behavior for a year. There was no criminal trial.” There was no mention of the apology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think the fact that he doesn’t mention an apology does not really add or take away anything from the story at hand, which is what happened afterward and what happened to him. It is a personal account, which by the way, and I think should be said, is part of a package in the magazine. It doesn’t stand on its own. It’s with two other articles that give different accounts and different angles on male behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do you not feel that there is a statement being made putting him on the cover, which says “The Fall of Men,” next to these other pieces? The headline of the piece is “Reflections From a Hashtag,” which feels dismissive of #MeToo to me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, not at all. In none of these pieces is anybody making an argument against #MeToo. All we have done is take three pieces, which I would hope help the readers to think through a very fraught issue in our time. It is certainly not a statement against #MeToo. It is trying to understand bad male behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a guy who has avoided real punishment says he has had “enough humiliation for a lifetime” and is a victim of “mass shaming,” that does seem to be a comment on what follows accusations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is his comment. It is a personal account. So he is expressing what it felt like to him. It is not me saying that. It is not me saying that’s good. It’s not me saying that’s bad. You need to find as many fresh ways to analyze, express, and describe what’s going on as you can, and this is one angle I hadn’t read yet. Until I read [John] Hockenberry in Harper’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Review of Books published Mary McCarthy and Elizabeth Hardwick. It’s prestige. I assume you only print pieces that reach a certain quality as written work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, that’s true. The point being that everyone whose name is above an article at the Review has to be absolutely beyond reproach in their private and public life? I don’t think so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, you have published Naipaul and Mailer, who did not behave well with women. This seems different. Last question: Last year, near the end of which you took over, VIDA, an organization that measures gender parity in publishing, reported that your publication “had the most pronounced gender disparity of 2017’s VIDA Count, with only 23.3% of published writers who are women.” Are you making an active effort to change that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes. We are very conscious of having as many women writing in each issue as we can. I don’t believe in quotas. I believe in having things that are of the greatest interest. But we make an effort with every issue to have as many female voices as we can get. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Have you heard any complaints from contributors about this piece? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last question: If— NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many last questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Harvey Weinstein wanted to write an essay for you on his post-#MeToo experiences, assuming he isn’t convicted, or the statute of limitations had passed, would you consider publishing it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I don’t think I can answer that question because it is not only a hypothetical but an extremely unlikely event, since he has been accused of rape, which Ghomeshi was never accused of. I think it’s a very different case. If somebody was accused of rape—let alone convicted for it—no, I wouldn’t have the same attitude. I think that is partly the problem. People very quickly conflate cases of criminal behavior with cases that are sometimes murkier and can involve making people feel uncomfortable, verbally or physically, and that really has very little to do with rape or criminal violence. I think it is a mistake to too quickly dissolve those distinctions.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Dr. Coburn was obviously joking and would be happy to personally apologize to any of his colleagues who were offended,” Hart told CBS NEWS. “That said, his frustration with a Congress that has inflicted severe economic damage on the country is well-known and well-founded.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coburn’s remarks on Wednesday, reported by the Tulsa World, represent a tour de force of conservative thought. He said the nation’s health care system was better before Medicare existed, even as he noted that some people received poor care at the time and doctors often accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can’t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He told a group at the Integris Mayes County Medical Center in Pryor, Okla.: “Show me where in the Constitution the federal government is responsible for your health care?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Without specifying what he meant, Coburn said President Barack Obama has an “intent is to create dependency because it worked so well for him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The World’s caption below a photo of Coburn reads the understated: “Disagrees with Obama’s politics.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As an African-American male,” Coburn said, Obama received “tremendous advantage from a lot of these programs.” The programs were not identified in the World report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coburn, a friend of Obama’s from their shared time in the Senate, added that Congress is to blame for most of the nation’s problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think presidents matter that much,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chickens remark harkens to the 2010 Nevada GOP Senate primary, when then-front-runner Sue Lowden proposed paying a health care barter system that would include paying physicians with chickens. Lowden lost the primary to Sharron Angle, who then lost the general election to Sen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First, back to the future with Chicken Care … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can’t tell me the system is better now than it was before Medicare,” he said. Coburn agreed that some people received poor care - or no care - before Medicare was enacted in the 1960s, but said communities worked together to make sure most people received needed medical attention. He also conceded that doctors and hospitals often went unpaid for their efforts, or accepted baked goods or chickens in partial payment.

{"context": "Representatives with the Center for Biological Diversity say this is a picture of the wolf that has been seen around the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A wayward gray wolf has been spotted several times this month around the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, according to conservationists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wolf, which is wearing an inactive radio collar, could be the first of its species to roam Arizona in 70 years; gray wolves were exterminated from the state in the 1940s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal authorities are investigating the sightings. Representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said they are trying to confirm whether the animal is actually a wolf or a \"wolf-dog hybrid\" by collecting a feces sample. [In Photos: The Fight Over Gray Wolves' Endangered Status] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The animal doesn't appear to be a hybrid, at least in photos taken by observers, but the possibility can't be ruled out until a genetic test is conducted, said Michael Robinson, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit environmental group based in Tucson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Until more is known about this animal, visitors to the area are cautioned that this may be a wolf from the northern Rocky Mountain population and [is] fully protected under the Endangered Species Act,\" FWS representatives said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the wolf did indeed come from the northern Rocky Mountain population, it would have traveled across hundreds of miles to get to northern Arizona; the southernmost breeding population of gray wolves in the Rockies lives just south of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Robinson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gray wolves once lived across most of the continental United States, but the predators were aggressively hunted and sometimes killed for bounties through the early 20th century. By the mid-20th century, the only places gray wolves could be found below the Canadian border were a sliver of land in northern Minnesota and Michigan's Isle Royale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The species was then protected under the Endangered Species Act in the 1970s. Conservation efforts and reintroduction programs helped gray wolves return to parts of their range. There are now more than 5,000 gray wolves in the continental United States, primarily in the western Great Lakes states of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, and the northern Rocky Mountain states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, as well as eastern Oregon and Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A small population of Mexican wolves (a subspecies of gray wolves) has also been reintroduced to parts of Arizona and New Mexico. The gray wolf spotted in Grand Canyon National Park does not appear to be a Mexican wolf, because its body is bulkier and its ears are more compact than those of a typical Mexican wolf, Robinson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sightings of the Grand Canyon gray wolf are reminiscent of another recent episode involving a wandering male wolf, OR-7, also known as Journey. OR-7 rose to fame in 2012 after he left his pack in Oregon to go to California, becoming the first known wolf in the state in 87 years. Since then, the wolf (which is tracked by a radio collar) has gone back and forth between Oregon and California several times. As of this summer, he was raising his first puppies with a mate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OR-7's travels raised hopes that California could once again be home to wild wolves. Similarly, the lone wolf in Arizona is an encouraging sign that it's possible for the species to make a comeback in the remote lands around the Grand Canyon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfortunately, many roving wolf stories don't have happy endings. When wildlife officials find out about a wolf that has ventured outside its usual territory, it's often because the creature has been shot or found dead, Robinson said. Last year, coyote hunters shot and killed wolves in Missouri and Kansas. A wolf that wandered from Montana to Colorado in 2009 was killed by poison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has put forth a proposal to take gray wolves off the Endangered Species List, claiming that recovery goals have been met for the animals. Earlier this year, an independent peer review concluded that there is wide disagreement about some of the science the agency used to support the proposal. Some biologists and conservationists have voiced concern that delisting the wolves would prevent the species from recolonizing other states and leave the animals vulnerable to unsustainable hunting policies. FWS officials were expected to make a final ruling on the embattled proposal by the end of the year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Megan Gannon on Twitter and Google+.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the animal turns out to be a gray wolf, as some wildlife experts suspect—and hope—the sightings would mark the first time a gray wolf has been seen in the Grand Canyon area since the 1940s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People nearly hunted the predator to extinction in the United States, where it had roamed across much of the country for centuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several people have photographed the Grand Canyon canid, which is wearing some kind of collar, on Arizona's Kaibab Plateau in recent weeks, just north of Grand Canyon National Park, according to the U.S. government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it's not a gray wolf, it's likely a Mexican gray wolf, which is a rarer subspecies, or a wolf-dog hybrid, says Jeff Humphrey, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Southwest Region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NG STAFF. SOURCE: NATIONAL PARK SERVICE; U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE; USGS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any of those animals could wear a collar, but the mystery animal's collar looks similar to those used in the Northern Rocky Mountains, where the gray wolf was reintroduced in 1995, according to a FWS press release. (See an interactive of the return of the wolf to much of the United States.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on photographs, the animal also does not appear to be a Mexican wolf—which is smaller than a gray wolf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only way to definitively identify it, Humphrey told National Geographic, is to analyze the DNA in its poop—which the agency is doing now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until the analysis is complete, the government is asking the public to treat the creature like a gray wolf from the Northern Rocky Mountains, which is an endangered animal with federal protection. (See more stunning gray wolf pictures.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on their recent rebound—there are now 1,700 gray wolves roaming the West after their population had been limited to the upper Midwest for decades—the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed taking the species off the Endangered Species List in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our first area of concern is the welfare of the animal,\" Humphrey said, especially since the Grand Canyon is heavily visited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by Jim and Jamie Dutcher, National Geographic NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Super Roamers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gray wolves are legendary for traveling long distances, and it's feasible that an animal could have traveled from its home in Wyoming or another Rocky Mountain state through Utah and into Arizona, experts say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At about two or two-and-a-half years of age, young wolves set out seeking new territory, often roaming far from their homes, said National Geographic Young Explorer Jay Simpson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For several months this year, Simpson tracked a lone gray wolf, dubbed OR-7, through Oregon into California as part of the Wolf OR-7 Expedition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wearing a GPS collar, the young male traversed over 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) to become the first and only documented free-roaming wolf in California in nearly 90 years, according to the expedition website. (See a related video of OR-7's epic journey.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on the attention that the Fish and Wildlife Service is putting on the case, Simpson suspects the Grand Canyon animal is a gray wolf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's really exciting in the sense that wolves continue to display remarkable abilities—they continue to disperse to areas where they previously lived.\" (Read \"Wolf Wars\" in National Geographic magazine.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the Grand Canyon animal is a gray wolf that's wearing a GPS collar, the collar must be out of batteries, since Humphrey said efforts to track it have been unsuccessful. (Read how scientists collar wild wolves.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said collaring is crucial for understanding animal behavior—for instance, if the wolf did have a functional collar, it would reveal \"invaluable data\" about where it has been, including how the animal negotiated various terrain—and threats—through the Northern Rockies.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thanks to scientific advances that led to effective antiretroviral therapy for treating HIV infection, many people living with HIV have near-normal lifespans. However, people living with HIV are at risk for developing end-stage liver and kidney disease and, like people without HIV infection, can benefit from organ transplantation. In this regard, results from an NIAID-funded study of 275 people with HIV who received a kidney or liver from an uninfected donor showed that outcomes and survival rates were similar to those of transplant recipients without HIV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The use of organs from donors with HIV infection for transplantation into recipients with HIV infection would increase the number of organs available for everyone on the transplant waiting list. However, little information about the outcome of using organs from people with HIV is available, and the HOPE Act stipulates that organ transplantation from one person with HIV infection to another must be conducted under a clinical research protocol. The safeguards and research criteria aim to ensure that such research is conducted safely and will provide a basis for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of organ transplantation between people with HIV infection.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soylu said the first explosion was caused by a passing vehicle that detonated in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moment later, a person who had been stopped in nearby Macka Park committed suicide by triggering explosives, according to the minister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The civilian death toll was lower because fans had already left the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium after the soccer match when the blasts occurred. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soylu said 136 people remained hospitalized Sunday after the attack, including 14 under intensive care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forensic experts in white uniforms worked overnight, scouring the vicinity of the stadium and the vast park where the suicide bombing took place.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday's incident marked one of the bloodiest to hit the bustling city at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. A triple suicide-and-gun attack on the city's Ataturk Airport in June killed 44 people and wounded scores of others. Kurdish-linked militants have claimed other deadly attacks in Ankara, Istanbul and areas of the southeast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The steady stream of violence has delivered a bitter blow to Turkey's tourism sector, a mainstay of the country's economy. Soylu acknowledged the country was struggling against \"many elements\" trying to compromise its fight against terrorism.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Turkey's pro-Kurdish People Democratic Party, or HDP, issued a statement \"strongly condemning\" the attacks and saying it \"felt great sadness and shared in the sorrow.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Turkish authorities, particularly the president, have routinely accused the party of being linked to the PKK and backing terrorism. The party, which had both of its leaders detained in terror probes and multiple elected officials arrested or removed from public service in the southeast, denies the charge.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jacques Ruffin, 21, found the letter addressed to his mother while he was cleaning out the hallway closet and decided to share it on Reddit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many thousands of people have commented on the post to applaud the \"beautiful\" and \"kind\" gesture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter was sent by James W Jones, who owns the Allegro Music Centre in Florida, in 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Jones addressed the difficulty Mr Ruffin's mother was having in meeting the repayments by noting he too had been \"through bad times\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to the BBC, Mr Ruffin, who was 13 years old at the time the letter was written, said: \"I had no idea that my mother was struggling so much financially.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Jacques Ruffin Image caption Jacques Ruffin called Mr Jones a \"hero\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that he is \"so grateful\" to Mr Jones for giving him \"the gift of music\" which has \"opened so many doors in my life\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I really appreciate what he did. He is a hero in my eyes,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The heartwarming post encouraged many others to share similar stories of the kindness shown to them in times of difficulty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One Reddit user wrote about receiving free piano tuition after their father died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Boygirlwhatever / Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some replied to say they were customers of the music shop and \"can clearly see this happening there\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Jones told the BBC he remembers why he decided to write off Mrs Ruffin's outstanding payments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was during an [economic] depression and the mother was ill and had lost her job.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said all he wants is \"to get instruments into the hands of kids who want to learn\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people commented on the social media post to say they had been inspired to donate their own instruments so other children can learn to play. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Ruffin told the BBC that the letter has spurred him to set up a funding campaign to help support children to study music. ||||| Store owner Jim Jones says he is surprised and overwhelmed by all the attention. (Photo: vorpib/Reddit) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Jacques Ruffin found an old letter his mother had saved, he almost tossed it. But he thought he better take a look. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The letter touched my heart. Reading the letter brought me to near tears and I wondered how life would’ve turned out if it wasn’t for the kindness of James W. Jones,\" Ruffin tells MNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ruffin shared the note on Reddit. The touching letter struck a chord with Redditors around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Music store owner James Jones wrote to Jacques' mother in 2009, forgiving the rent due on her son's trumpet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You do not have to pay me any more for the trumpet. It is yours to play,\" Jones wrote. \"I have been through bad times like you. But remember. Tough times never last, Tough people do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This letter sparked some serious online kindness. (Photo: jacques4801/Reddit) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The internet can be a tough place, but not in this case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Posters were touched by the store owner's kind note and immediately came up with suggestions to respond in kind. Some people thought they should pay it forward, sending instruments to band kids in need. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the majority suggested paying it backward to the store owner. People offered to send anonymous donations so he could buy more instruments to help more kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Small music stores are often in pretty rough shape these days. The internet has killed, or is killing, all but the most hardy/stubborn local stores ... I'd be surprised if this guy is making a killing running his music store,\" wrote SwellJoe. \"Seems like chipping in to pay for a trumpet or two for the store owner to give away isn't such a terrible idea for paying it forward and helping out a small business owner who was kind to a kid and a struggling mom (and this probably isn't an isolated incident).\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And it turns out that really is the case, Redditor vorpib found out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doughnuts and donations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he read the post, he realized he lived only minutes away from Allegro Music Center in Casselberry, a suburb of Orlando. So he decided to drop by when the store opened, armed with a dozen doughnuts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In talking with an overwhelmed Jones, vorpib discovered that this wasn't the first time the store owner had assisted someone in need. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He said he’s been doing this for years, helping out kids who haven’t been able to make the payments,\" vorpib tells MNN. \"It’s such a cool thing. He was so humble. I don’t think he’s crazy about all the attention.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hoping to continue to help other struggling young musicians just like Jones did, Ruffin started a GoFundMe to benefit music students in need. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And because the music store may have seen better days, Redditors hope that some kindness (and donations) may help brighten Jones' day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would like to push the idea that we donate something to him, and hopefully this will go viral so that his customer base also grows after all this has died down,\" suggested gjs628. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The whole point of this is to say, 'That small kindness that you did — completely out of the blue for a struggling mother and her son — hasn’t gone unnoticed, and we would like to thank you for not just the kindness but being the person you are, who expected nothing in return.' He didn’t do this with the expectation of recognition or gain, he did this out of the kindness of his own heart.\""}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Wisconsin-born Trickle raced during the 1970s and 1980s, then broke through as a full-time and widely recognized NASCAR driver in 1989. By that time, according to a Sports Illustrated article , the 48-year-old grandfather of two had won some 1,200 stock car competitions in 31 years of racing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He settled in Lincoln County, in central North Carolina, in the early 1990s, according to the sheriff's office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Trickle never managed a victory in NASCAR's premier Sprint Cup series, he did have 15 top-five finishes and won two Nationwide Series races before his retirement in 2002.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dick Trickle went to doctors twice a day, his brother said, to try to get rid of the problem. But the cause of his pain never was determined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, the popular former NASCAR driver died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in Boger City, N.C., authorities said. Dick Trickle was 71. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a shock to me,” said Chuck Trickle, who lives in Las Vegas and used to race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Bullring. “It’s real hard to think about. He was my brother, my friend and my hero, in that order.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck Trickle said his brother was healthy, except for the pain under his breast. The brothers spoke a week ago, and Chuck Trickle knew it was serious when he heard Dick Trickle curse for the first time that he could remember. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was very down,” Chuck Trickle said. “He more or less said he didn’t know how much longer he could take the pain.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn’t the first tragedy to hit the Trickle family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck’s son, Chris, was shot in 1997 while driving over the Blue Diamond Road overpass. He died the following year, and the case never was solved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “To lose (Dick) and to lose my son takes a lot out of me,” Chuck Trickle said. “This is not easy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dick Trickle earned his reputation as a successful short-track driver before joining the Winston Cup Series and earning rookie of the year in 1989 at age 48. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He competed in more than 300 Cup races. Although he never won a Cup race and won just two Busch Series races, Trickle earned cult status. Former ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann regularly would mention where Trickle finished after each NASCAR race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine said there was only one way to describe Trickle, a native of Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Fun,” Bodine told The Associated Press. “Just plain fun.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trickle never was one to be told how to live his life. He was known for cutting a hole in his racing helmet so he could have a cigarette during cautions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He always kept a cigarette lighter in his car,” Bodine said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chuck Trickle said his brother was so beloved that “he could’ve run for president and won.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was there for everybody,” Chuck Trickle said. “He left a very large footprint on this earth.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dick Trickle’s body was found near his truck at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City, about 40 miles northwest of Charlotte. A Lincoln County sheriff’s lieutenant said foul play was not suspected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff’s office said authorities received a call believed to be from Trickle, who said “there would be a dead body and it would be his.” Authorities tried to call the number back, but no one answered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trickle lived in Iron Station, N.C., for more than 20 years. Bodine said Trickle was full of stories and popular because of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People everywhere knew his name,” Bodine said. “That’s why they used his likeness in that movie ‘Days of Thunder.’ He was such a character.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main character in that popular niche racing movie, played by Tom Cruise, was named Cole Trickle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bodine said that a few years ago he had to back out of a celebrity cruise for patients who were on kidney dialysis. He asked Trickle to fill in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He made such an impression on people on that ship that everyone wanted to know when Dick was coming back,” Bodine said. “They loved him. They tell me he was the last man to leave most of the bars on the ship, and I believe it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Associated Press contributed to this report.

{"context": "A couple of weeks ago I was invited to the Playboy mansion for a screening of that new Jennifer Lopez/Jason Statham movie, Parker. I don't usually go to press screenings because it's much easier to download the movie and watch it at home and not have to talk to other people, but I'd literally wanted to visit the Playboy mansion ever since I'd found out it was an option for me several seconds earlier. So I HAD to go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the screening there was a reception featuring drinks and \"photo opportunities\" with some Playboy Playmates™® in the mansion's main entry hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hugh was supposed to be in attendance too, but he was sick. So we had to make do with this thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The screening was held in the drawing room. Here's an exclusive sneak preview of it. This is from a scene where (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) Jason Statham hits someone with something. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right after I took this picture, I whispered something to the girl sitting next to me and a guy wearing a suit with Converse shoes came over and told me off for being too loud. A suit with Converses is my least favorite look ever. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to be yelled at by someone wearing an outfit that was last acceptable on Tom Green at the 2003 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards? Horrifying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I needed to get out of there, so I decided to \"get lost\" while trying to find the bathroom and see how long I could wander around the mansion before someone made me go back to the movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first thing I did was go find a bathroom to poop in. I didn't even need to, really. But how often do you get a chance to poop in the Playboy mansion? This is what you get to see while you're pooping there, if you were wondering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After pooping, I started to notice how crappy everything was. Am I an idiot for thinking the mansion would be nice? I figured it would at least be a little bit fancy. That was the main reason I'd wanted to visit—I'm gay, btw. Wait, are straight people even into the women in Playboy anymore? Or did that stop in the 90s? How does Playboy still exist now that the internet exists? Who on Earth is buying the magazine? The kind of person who wears a suit with Converse, probably. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyway, this is less nice than my bathroom at home. I keep my air freshener in a cupboard and everything. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I mean, obviously this is a lovely bathroom. All marble-y and stuff. But toilet-seat covers have been \"a thing\" for at least as long as I've been alive. You'd think they would've put in a dispenser or something by now. This is what I imagine those mansions in London that are owned by oil billionaires and end up getting squatted by Italian crusties look like inside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After finishing my business, I wandered through a couple of the other rooms. Most of the stuff in the house was your standard, totally impersonal McMansion-type stuff like giant ceramic animals and vases full of sticks. But there were a few personal effects dotted around, like pictures of Hugh with the cast of the Charlie's Angels movie and a photo from his recent wedding to a 26-year-old. (Which we can't publish here because of lawyerly stuff.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was also this lovely statue of the \"happy\" \"couple.\" It's amazing how the sculptor was able to bring out the creepiness of the situation, even in bronze. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's the phone extensions that were by all the phones in the house. I'm not sure if you can see, but there are THREE separate extensions that deal with scrapbooking. Cute! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I headed outside, where I ran into this guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And went for a wander around the pool area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is \"the Grotto.\" Which, for some reason, I knew exists. It was also really rundown and depressing. Look at that seat on the left. It looks like something somebody would overdose on in Russia... :( NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this was embedded in the wall. Seriously, what the fuck is this? It can't be a phone, it has too many buttons. I'm pretty sure I saw Mr. Burns use one of these once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I found out I was going to the Playboy mansion, \"steal a towel\" went straight to the top of my mental to-do list. But look at these fucking things. I was expecting plush Egyptian-cotton thingies with the Playboy logo embroidered on them. My towels are nicer than this, and I found one of mine on a train. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fuck, is \"the towels weren't nice enough to steal\" an actual complaint I just made? Gross. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatever, I took this picture in another bathroom. It looks like something that would accompany a 1-star TripAdvisor review of a Polish ski resort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Down a corridor, I found this room. I suppose at one point, when fun things still happened at the Playboy mansion, it would have been some kind of orgy room or something. But now it just looks like this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It had another one of those steampunk, time-machine things, too. And a minifridge that is at least twice as old as I am. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was full of Playboy-branded bottled water (which I stole a couple bottles of, obv). Note the tape holding the mechanism on to the back of the fridge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is when I started to get really bummed out. Nothing upsets me more than seeing something that was once glorious fall into decay. I nearly cried once while looking at one of those Us Weekly \"Worst Celebrity Plastic Surgery\" lists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wandering through the house gave me a feeling not too dissimilar to when a relative dies and you have to go to their place and figure out what to do with their things. Except for, in this case, that dead relative was the magazine industry. Or something. I don't really know what I'm talking about. But the mansion was really, really sad. And it smelled like old man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then somebody asked me if I was lost. So I headed back inside to watch the rest of the movie. Spoiler alert: Jennifer Lopez has an ass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As I was leaving, I was surrounded by a gaggle of playmates for one of the photo opportunities I'd managed to avoid on the way in. They were, without question, the most charming and charismatic people I've ever met in my entire life. I can guarantee that if I were straight, I would have written all three of them into my will within three minutes of meeting them. Which, I suppose, is the point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can someone straight and rich and old go rescue them from that sad old house? Please?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A $100 million deal to sell the historic Playboy mansion to businessman Daren Metropoulos has closed, marking the largest residential sale in the history of Los Angeles County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I feel fortunate and privileged to now own a one-of-a-kind piece of history and art,” said Metropoulos in a statement. “The Playboy Mansion is one of the most iconic properties in the world and the crown jewel of Holmby Hills and the platinum triangle.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the deal was announced in early June, the exact price of the Playboy Mansion was not disclosed, although when the five-acre property initially hit the market in January it had a sticker price of $200 million. It ultimately sold for half of that. According to the release, Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy Enterprises, will continue to occupy the mansion for the remainder of his lifetime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It appeared the sale of the Playboy Mansion to Metropoulos was in peril after TMZ reported earlier this month that deal had fallen apart. That TMZ report proved erroneous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy will pay Metropoulos $1 million a year for upkeep of the property while Hefner is living there, people with knowledge of the deal told The Hollywood Reporter. According to a source, one sticking point in the negotiations was the leaseback deal and the access that Metropoulos would have to the property while Hefner lived there. The parties agreed that Metropoulos would give Hefner ample notice before coming to the property. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sale also represents the largest residential sale in L.A. County history. In 2014 the 40,000 square foot Fleur de Lys mansion sold for a total price of $102 million but that sum included almost $14 million in furniture that was added to the sales price. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2009, 33-year old Metropoulos acquired the house next to the Playboy Mansion, which includes the original gate that connects to the Playboy Mansion. Metropoulos said he will combine the two properties after Mr. Hefner’s tenancy ends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mansion has 29 rooms, which include 12 bedrooms, a game room, a wine cellar and a screening room. The park-like grounds feature a zoo with an arboretum, a tennis court, an orchard and the infamous swimming pool with a swim-in grotto. The property also includes four-bedroom guest house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gary Gold and Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland and Mauricio Umansky of The Agency held the listing.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For more than four decades, the Playboy Mansion has been synonymous with sleazy glamour and easy women – a monument to one man’s warped view of the world, a grown-up fantasyland known for A-list guests, wild parties and even wilder girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But today the famed personal fiefdom created by Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner is far from the ­hedonist’s paradise imagined by the public, according to British twins Carla and Melissa Howe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an exclusive interview, the 24-year-old Slough sisters, who split their time between the £34million ­Californian mansion and the UK, tell how the recession, 88-year-old Hefner’s latest marriage and his increasing frailty have all combined to make his empire more Saga than swinger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These days, bunnies and ­playmates are more likely to be asked to join Hef in a gentle game of tennis than a romp in the hot tub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See inside the Playboy Mansion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are three movie nights a week, mostly featuring his favourite films from the 1950s. And any inmate who wants to leave in search of a social life is subject to a strict 9pm curfew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, say the twins, the ­security at the 22-bedroomed pile is so strict it’s “like being in prison”. Says Carla: “When you’re here you have to be in by the 9pm curfew. You’re not allowed to invite any friends up to see you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You’re definitely not allowed male visitors. If you break the rules you get banned. Once you’re out, you’re out, you can’t come back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Hef’s wife Crystal went to do a DJ set miles away so she had to stay overnight. But she was still back by 2pm the next day. ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the credit crunch that has hit the world has resulted in cutbacks that mean it’s not as ­luxurious as it once was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: WireImage) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Playboy Bunnies’ £630-a-week allowance has been axed. Now they’re down to free room and board at the mansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Playmate of the Year used to get a Porsche,” reveals Carla, who knows a thing or two about cars from her motor-loving ex, Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Now she gets a Mini Cooper that she has to return after a year!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while the Mansion still hosts its fair share of celebrity events, where the likes of Lewis Hamilton and Snoop Dogg walk the red carpet, it is now available to rent for private parties.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After all, former Playmate Kendra Wilkinson recently revealed in the Celebrity jungle how she had to get “very drunk and very stoned” to endure sex sessions with the ­octogenarian tycoon 10 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the twins, age, ill health and his two-year marriage to model Crystal Harris, 28, have finally made a faithful husband out of Hef. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m really relieved,” says Carla. “In the past he would have slept with all the girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve heard stories about him having 16 girls in the grotto and once he’d finished they would be passed on to the next man there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: PLANET PHOTOS) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But now it’s not like that. To be honest, he’s so old now I couldn’t imagine him trying to make a move. He has to walk with people around him because he’s frail.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A fake American news website reported just before Christmas that he’d been found dead at the mansion. It turned out to be a hoax. But he’s still a shadow of his former self, insist the twins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s like being with a grandad,” says Carla. “Not long ago they called in the nurse because he’d had a fall in the grotto. The only woman that sleeps with him now is Crystal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melissa, who previously dated Ashley Cole, admits: “His friends can be a bit flirty – but the only men NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR we really didn’t like were from a private party held there. They were really pervy, all the girls were fighting to run away.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if Hefner’s sexual appetite is waning, his business instinct is as sharp as ever, says Carla. “He reads everything about the mansion. He gets press clippings brought every day with a box of his favourite doughnuts. He still sees it as a ­business, so you’d be surprised how strict it is.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melissa adds: “If you do something wrong, you’ll get an email. There’s a strict code of conduct. There are even rules about Instagram and Twitter.You’ve got to show everything in a good light and if you’re drunk in a picture you’ll be in trouble.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hefner has a novel way of putting even minor offenders in their place – ordeal by seating plan. “There are three dining tables,” explains Melissa. “In one room is Hef’s top table where everyone wants to sit, then the family table which is second best. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But in another room beside the kitchen is the table for the more lowly guests, the nobodies and the girls who’ve annoyed him. Hef decides the seating plan every day and no one wants to end up on that third table.” There’s a zoo in the gardens and a games room with old PacMan machines, but the main entertainment is the mandatory film nights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Friday, Saturday and Sunday are movie nights,” explains Carla.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sundays are best because you get films that haven’t been on in the cinema yet – we saw the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part One – but on Fridays it’s always a 1950s movie and they’re really boring.We try to hide but there’s not as many girls there as you’d think - it’ll usually just be a few of us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One regular guest is Hefner’s lookalike son Cooper, 23. But, says Carla, the heir is nothing like his dad, despite rumours he’s being groomed to takeover the empire. “He’s got a girlfriend and he’s shy around the girls,” she laughs. “And a bit geeky.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the twins there’s a ­suggestion of disappointment that the Playboy Mansion is mostly life in the slow lane now.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE- In this July 10, 2015 file frame from dashcam video provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety, trooper Brian Encinia arrests Sandra Bland after she became combative during a routine traffic... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bland, a 28-year-old Chicago-area woman, was found dead in her Waller County jail cell in Hempstead, about 200 miles south of Dallas, on July 13, three days after her arrest. Officials say she used a plastic bag to hang herself, a finding her family has questioned. Bland's family and others also have criticized Trooper Brian Encinia, who stopped Bland for failing to signal a lane change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Associated Press obtained Encinia's personnel file Friday from the Texas Department of Public Safety through a Freedom of Information Act request. Encinia had been with the department for a little over a year. For the most part, his file was unremarkable. He received \"competent\" ratings in all of the evaluations that were released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, in an evaluation that covered September and October 2014, his supervisor noted that Encinia \"was given a written counseling for unprofessional conduct ... for an incident occurring while at a school in Austin.\" The documents provided no additional details and a Department of Public Safety official did not return a phone call seeking comment Friday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evaluation goes on to say, \"In the future, Trooper Encinia should conduct himself at all times in a manner that will reflect well upon himself, the Department, and the State of Texas. This supervisor will ensure that this is done by meeting periodically with Trooper Encinia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the category of \"Stress Tolerance\" in the same evaluation, his supervisor remarked that Encinia \"performed effectively and rationally while involved in a pursuit resulting in a firearms discharge during the reporting period.\" The document did not provide additional details about that incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documents also did not include any information about Encinia's interaction with Bland. That is still under investigation, though the director of the Department of Public Safety, Steve McCraw, has said Encinia violated internal policies of professionalism and courtesy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dashcam video shows the confrontation between Bland and Encinia swiftly escalated after she objected to being told to put out her cigarette. Encinia at one point is seen holding a stun gun as he says, \"I will light you up!\" after Bland refuses to get out of her car. Bland, who was black, eventually was arrested for allegedly assaulting the white trooper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bland's death came after nearly a year of heightened national scrutiny of police and their dealings with black suspects, especially those who have been killed by officers or die in police custody. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to his personnel file, Encinia was selected for the Trooper Trainee Academy in December 2013, joined the Department of Public Safety in June 2014 as a probationary trooper and completed his probation in June 2015, becoming a Highway Patrol trooper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Encinia's most recent performance evaluation was for November and December 2014. Among the remarks were that Encinia \"appears to operate effectively under stress,\" ''continues to use good problem solving skills and judgment while working patrol\" and \"appears to treat others in a respectful manner.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before applying for trooper training, Encinia was a volunteer firefighter in Brenham, where he was a supervisor at Blue Bell Creameries. Brenham Fire Chief Ricky Boeker remembered Encinia as a \"stand-up kind of guy\" popular with the people he worked with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Encinia, a 2008 graduate of Texas A&M University, was elected as a district chief, Boeker said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The records, which include Encinia's job application and personnel file, provide some additional details about his background before joining DPS last year. According to the records, he studied at Texas A&M University, graduating in 2008.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: Waller DA assigns outside prosecutor, releases Sandra Bland toxicology report NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his stop of Bland in Prairie View - originally for an improper lane change - a confrontation occurred between Encinia and Bland after he asked her to put out her cigarette and she refused. Dash cam footage captured portions of the incident, and showed Encinia threatening Bland with a Taser and repeatedly ordering her to get out of her car. He eventually arrested her for assaulting a public servant; Encinia said she had kicked him during the arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bland, 28, died three days later in Waller County jail. Authorities ruled the death a suicide by hanging. The incident sparked international outrage and protests and vigils across the country, and brought widespread scrutiny to the Waller County Sheriff's Office and their jail, particularly after authorities said that Bland had told two separate jailers during her intake at the jail that she had previously tried to commit suicide.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When your message is simply I am for new leadership and cleaning up Washington, and you look like you just walked out of an Orvis catalog, you are going to connect with voters on both sides of the aisle,” wrote Salena Zito in The Washington Examiner late last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Lamb never slams Trump,” she observed. “He is not part of the resistance.” He further blunted Republicans’ favorite weapon against Democratic candidates for the House — they’re just would-be pawns of the dreaded Nancy Pelosi! — by running an ad that made clear that he would not support her as his party’s leader in that chamber. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The point that Zito was correctly making was that many of the Democrats who will vie to unseat Republican incumbents in House races in November won’t be able to follow Lamb’s playbook. To get through their party’s primaries, they’ll have to stake out more progressive ground than he did, and adopt a more combative, fiery tone. That could undercut their chances of replicating his success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, Democrats’ euphoria over how he fared on Tuesday will give way to sharp internal tensions and sustained quarreling over which sorts of candidates — soft-spoken or bold, centrist or liberal, eclectic or pure — the party would be wisest, from a pragmatic standpoint, to promote. Many Democratic voters want someone less mild and muddled than Lamb.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MT. LEBANON, Pa. (AP) — A razor's edge separated Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone early Wednesday in their closely watched special election in Pennsylvania, where a surprisingly strong bid by first-time candidate Lamb severely tested Donald Trump's sway in a GOP stronghold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb claimed victory before exuberant supporters after midnight, though many absentee ballots were still to be counted in the contest that has drawn national attention as a bellwether for the midterm elections in November when the Republican Party's House and Senate majorities are at risk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb, a Marine veteran, told his crowd that voters had directed him to \"do your job\" in Washington. \"Mission accepted,\" he declared. Earlier, Saccone told his own supporters, \"It's not over yet, we're going to fight all the way, all the way to the end, we'll never give up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless of the outcome — and a recount was possible — Lamb's showing in a district Trump won by 20 points in the presidential race was sure to stoke anxiety among Republicans nationwide and renewed enthusiasm among Democrats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After midnight with all precincts reporting, unofficial results had Lamb leading Republican state Rep. Saccone by fewer than 600 votes. More than 1,000 absentee ballots were still being tabulated as the count carried into Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a race this close, either candidate's supporters can ask for a recount. However there are stiff requirements, including requiring three voters in the same precinct who can attest that error or fraud was committed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stakes in the high-profile special election were more political than practical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months, and the congressional district as currently shaped will likely vanish next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state's district maps. Yet President Trump and his chief allies invested tremendous time and resources in keeping the seat in Republican hands, mindful the contest could be used to measure Trump's lasting appeal among white, working-class voters and Democrats' anti-Trump fervor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House scrambled to rally voters behind Saccone, who cast himself as the president's \"wingman,\" but he struggled at times to connect with the blue-collar coalition that fueled Trump's victory little more than a year ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb, a 33-year old former federal prosecutor, asserted his independence from the Democratic Party, courted labor backing and focused on local issues. He studiously downplayed his opposition to the Republican president in the district where Trump's support has slipped by not plummeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This didn't have much to do with President Trump,\" Lamb said Tuesday after casting his vote in suburban Pittsburgh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president has campaigned in the district twice and sent several tweets on Saccone's behalf. Other recent visitors include the vice president, the president's eldest son, the president's daughter and the president's chief counselor. Outside groups aligned with Republicans poured more than $10 million of dollars into the contest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Democrats, a win would reverberate nationwide, while even a narrow loss would be viewed as a sign of increased Democratic enthusiasm just as the midterm season begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb's excited supporters included his middle school football and basketball coach, Joe DelSardo, who recalled him as \"a leader from the beginning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former coach described the district as having \"a lot of suit-and-tie people and people who dig in the dirt.\" Lamb, he said, \"can talk to all of them, and that's why he can win.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Registered Republican Brett Gelb said he voted for Saccone, largely because the Republican candidate promised to support the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Saccone backs a lot of President Trump's plans for the country,\" said Gelb, a 48-year-old fire technician who lives in Mt. Lebanon. He added, \"I do think Trump is doing a good job. I think he needs backup.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on the district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was open now only because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With polls showing a tight race for months, Saccone tried to persuade the GOP-leaning electorate that their choice was about \"making America great again,\" as the president repeatedly says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saccone, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran turned state lawmaker and college instructor, enjoyed enthusiastic backing from the social conservatives who've anchored his state career. He's been perhaps at his most animated when emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one-on-one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the Legislature should make voters' choice a no-brainer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb, meanwhile, excited core Democrats and aimed for independents and moderate Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We worked really hard for it,\" Lamb said after voting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National Republican groups filled airwaves and social media with depictions of the first-time candidate as little more than a lemming for Nancy Pelosi — the Democratic House leader that Republicans love to hate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb answered the criticism by saying he wouldn't support Pelosi as floor leader, much less as speaker if the Democrats should retake control of the House. He also said he opposes major new gun restrictions — though he backs expanded background checks — and declared himself personally opposed to abortion, despite his support for its legality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides bruising the president, a Lamb defeat also could shake Republican self-assurance that their new tax law can shield them from other political woes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lamb embraced Democratic orthodoxy on the new GOP tax law, hammering it as a giveaway to corporations at the future expense of Social Security, Medicare and the nation's fiscal security. And he embraces unions, highlighting Saccone's anti-labor record at the statehouse, which was a notable deviation from the retiring Murphy's status as a union-friendly Republican.

{"context": "Prosecutors who seek the death penalty more frequently than their peers have had alarmingly high rates of misconduct, according to a report analyzing the outsized impact the nation's most aggressive prosecutors have had on death sentencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report, \"America's Top Five Deadliest Prosecutors,\" released Thursday by Harvard Law School’s Fair Punishment Project, identifies five head prosecutors who, together, were responsible for 440 death sentences -- equivalent to approximately 15 percent of the current U.S. death row population. The prosecutors championed capital punishment more to feed their \"over-aggressive\" and \"reckless\" style than for the circumstances of the crimes, the report argues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Their overzealous pursuit of the death penalty does not accurately reflect America’s growing skepticism of the death penalty, nor is it representative of local constituencies that are more attached to the death penalty,\" the report reads. \"It better reflects the lack of meaningful controls on prosecutorial discretion and a lack of consequences for their illegal or unethical behavior.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report names Joe Freeman Britt of Robeson County, North Carolina; Bob Macy of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; Lynne Abraham of Philadelphia, and Johnny Holmes of Harris County, Texas -- all now retired. The fifth, Donnie Myers of Lexington, South Carolina, is still in office, but has announced he won't seek re-election and plans to step down in early 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fair Punishment Project NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britt, Myers and Macy each personally won more than 35 death sentences during their decades in office, the researchers found. Abraham and Holmes, who did not try many death penalty cases themselves, oversaw prosecutors' offices that obtained more than 300 death sentences collectively during their tenure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disturbingly, courts found high percentages of misconduct in death penalty cases under three of the prosecutors. Misconduct was found in 37 percent of Britt's death cases, 33 percent of Macy's cases and 46 percent of Myers' cases, according to the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And when four of these prosecutors retired, death sentences declined dramatically in their jurisdictions -- a trend that researchers say shows individual personalities drove the death sentencing rates, not commitment to capital punishment by local residents. Eight people sentenced to die under district attorneys on the list were later exonerated and released from death row. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What's striking is not just that there a few peculiar personalities that account for so many death sentences, but that their overzealous support for capital punishment comes paired with underzealous commitment to the rules and regulations that promote fairness and accuracy,\" Rob Smith, senior research fellow and director of Harvard Law's Fair Punishment Project, told The Huffington Post. \"These are not the people with the best temperament for the job of deciding between life and death, but the worst.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fair Punishment Project NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The use of capital punishment, plagued by controversy and a shortage of drugs used for lethal injections, has declining for the last 20 years. The number of executions have fallen to record lows in the modern death penalty era, with fewer people put to death in 2015 than since the 1970s. Some states banned capital punishment more than 150 years ago and now, 19 states and the District of Columbia have abolished the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, a majority of Americans continue to favor execution, even though no evidence shows it deters crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while most prosecutors pursue fewer death sentences than in the past, researchers note that the issue of personalty-driven death sentencing still happens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In counties that continue to vigorously impose the death penalty, \"a handful of prosecutors dominate death-sentencing statistics,\" the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers name three active prosecutors who, if they continue at their current rate, may one day find themselves atop the list of \"deadliest\" prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"watch\" list includes: Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda of Florida's Duval County, who has won 22 death sentences; Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Jeannette Gallagher, of Arizona, who has obtained nine death sentences; and Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert of Prince William County, Virginia, who has obtained at least 14 death sentences. ||||| Harvard report highlights the lion-sized role in modern death penalty of just four men and a woman, and how capital punishment is a ‘personality-driven system’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One had a poster from the movie Tombstone on his office wall with “Justice is coming” emblazoned on it; another used a miniature model of an electric chair as a paperweight; a third, dubbed the “Queen of death”, said she was “passionate” about judicially killing people and described the emotion of watching an execution as a “non-event”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What they all had in common was a vast appetite for putting men and women to death. What additionally made them special was that they all had the power to turn such unusual tastes into sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As head prosecutors in their counties, just five individuals have been responsible for putting no fewer than 440 prisoners onto death row. If you compare that number to the 2,943 who are currently awaiting execution in the US, it is equivalent to one out of every seven. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The business of securing death sentences: 40 years and 28 men Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or express the figure another way: of the 8,038 death sentences handed down since the death penalty was restarted in the modern era 40 years ago this week, some one in 20 of them have been the responsibility of those five district attorneys alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The five are profiled in a new report from Harvard Law School’s Fair Punishment Project. Titled America’s Top Five Deadliest Prosecutors, the report highlights the lion-sized role in the modern death penalty of just four men and one woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They are: Joe Freeman Britt of Robeson County, North Carolina; Donnie Myers of Lexington, South Carolina; Bob Macy of Oklahoma County; Lynne Abraham of Philadelphia County; and Johnny Holmes of Harris County, Texas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just how extraordinary this elite club of lawyers is can be seen in the biography of Bob Macy. Until his death in 2011, he was known as Cowboy Bob because of his traditional frontier dress sense: he always wore cowboy boots, a large cowboy hat, a black string tie, a black suit and a white shirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the course of 21 years as the top prosecutor in Oklahoma County, Macy put 54 people on death row. That gave him the distinction of sending more people to their potential deaths than any other district attorney in the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And many did actually go to their deaths. According to records compiled by the Fair Punishment Project, 30 of those prisoners were executed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might have presented an ethical burden to some, but not to Macy. As he sat beneath his Tombstone poster, he ruminated on the “patriotic duty” of prosecutors to aggressively pursue death sentences. He was proud of having sent a 16-year-old, Sean Sellers, to the death chamber before the US supreme court banned the execution of juveniles in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem is that Macy’s sense of legal propriety was not as honed as his sense of patriotic duty. The Harvard report notes that about a third of the 54 capital sentences he secured were later challenged and misconduct uncovered; three death-row prisoners were exonerated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A similarly disturbing pattern of misconduct and error is recorded by the other deadliest prosecutors. Britt, who died in April, obtained 38 death sentences in the course of his 14-year career.

It is the prosecutor’s job to extinguish that flame.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which is all very well, were it not for the fact that in more than a third of his cases ending in death sentences he was later found to have committed misconduct. Two of his death row inmates were exonerated: Leon Brown and Henry McCollum, two intellectually disabled brothers who were 15 and 19 respectively when they were set up for murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Myers is the only one of the five who is still in office, with plans to retire at the end of the year. The lawyer, the one with the electric chair paperweight on his desk, did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about his inclusion in the top five club of deadliest prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He achieved 39 death sentences in the course of his 38 years in practice but labored under a 46% rate of misconduct that was later discovered. Six of his death sentences were overturned due to problems in the way he had secured a capital sentence – often involving discriminatory exclusions of jurors based on race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report notes that Myers once rolled a baby’s crib draped in black cloth in front of a capital jury and, crying profusely, told them that a failure to return a death sentence would be like declaring “open season on babies in Lexington County”. In another death penalty case, he referred to the black defendant as “King Kong”, a “monster”, “caveman” and “beast of burden”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The grossly disproportionate impact of these district attorneys in just five of America’s 3,100 counties gives the lie to the US supreme court opinion, issued on 2 July 1976 in Gregg v Georgia, that reopened the death penalty in America. That ruling said that capital punishment could be practiced in such a way that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the past 40 years have shown it to be highly arbitrary. In a spirited dissent issued last year, Justice Stephen Breyer argued that it was time for the supreme court to consider whether the ultimate punishment should be ruled unconstitutional and banned outright. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breyer found that “40 years of experience make it increasingly clear that the death penalty is imposed arbitrarily, without the reasonable consistency legally necessary to reconcile its use with the constitution’s commands”. One of the examples he gave of inconsistency was that not only do some states allow the death penalty while others do not, but also “within a death penalty state, the imposition of the death penalty heavily depends on the county in which a defendant is tried”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Asked whether she had ever doubted the outcome of a capital case, Lynne Abraham said categorically that she never had. Photograph: Chris Gardner/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The remaining two of the five most deadly prosecutors did not personally secure all their own death sentences but did preside over teams of lawyers who put astonishing numbers of people onto death row. Lynne Abraham, known as the “Queen of death”, saw 108 capital sentences returned during her time as chief prosecutor in Philadelphia County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked whether she had ever doubted the outcome of a capital case, she said categorically that she never had. Yet two of her cases ended in exonerations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnny Holmes was the top prosecutor in Harris County, Texas, which covers Houston. During his 21 years in charge until his retirement in 2000, 201 people were sent to death row. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the Harvard team points out, as soon as Holmes retired, the number of death sentences secured in Harris County plummeted from an average of 12 a year during his heyday to just one a year now. That suggests that capital punishment in America is what the authors call a “personality-driven system”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They point out that despite the gradual decline of new death sentences across the country, the syndrome of overzealous prosecutors remains a problem today. The enduring distortion of the numbers, they say, is evidence that the application of the death penalty has always been less about the crime and the criminal, “and more a function of the personality and predilections of local prosecutors entrusted with the power to seek the ultimate punishment”."}

{"context": "Ted Cruz isn’t giving up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Donald Trump dispatches three advisers to Texas’s convention in Dallas this week and makes a pitch for party unity, his team will be running up against a Cruz operation that is still maneuvering to stuff the state’s delegation with allies the senator could call on to snub the presumptive nominee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have a busy weekend planned,” said a source familiar with the Cruz campaign’s plans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz is scheduled to deliver an address at the Texas convention after a week of hinting he could jump back into the presidential contest and urging activists to thwart the New Yorker’s takeover of the GOP’s policy platform. And despite dropping out of the race more than a week ago, the vanquished presidential contender has deployed at least one paid adviser to the Texas Republican convention – Tyler Norris, his state director. (Trump has three advisers: state director Joshua Jones, deputy director Eric Mahroum and Houston-area director Kayla Hensley.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s not just Texas where Cruz is still playing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senator’s team remains active in several of the other eight state conventions selecting delegates this week – from Nebraska to Oklahoma to Nevada. Those conventions, along with party meetings in Arkansas, Florida and Wisconsin, will be selecting 389 national delegates, nearly a sixth of the entire convention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Cruz were still working to send the nomination fight to a contested convention, this weekend’s delegate hunt would have been the main event – the largest single delegate selection weekend of the primary season. Now, it’s become a display of Cruz’s last hardcore bastions of support and a forum for Trump to appeal for unity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, Trump’s campaign appears to be making moves to heal a fractured party ahead of a challenging general election campaign – sending emissaries to build relationships on Capitol Hill, reassessing policy proposals, and setting up meetings between the candidate and senior party leaders, including Wednesday’s sit-down with House Speaker Paul Ryan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Trump campaign – they have to go unite Republicans. They’ve got to do that,” said Austin Barbour, a GOP leader in Mississippi, which is holding a convention this weekend. “I think he needs to go talk to the people who are Cruz people, who are Bush people. Donald Trump’s a bigtime underdog in this race. They need to tie down Republican votes and this weekend’s a good start for them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ed Brookover, one of Trump’s top delegate advisers, is expected to attend the Mississippi gathering. Another top Trump adviser, Alan Cobb, will have a presence at Kansas’s state convention on Saturday – and although the state went strongly for Cruz, its delegation to Cleveland is now likely to feature a more neutral group that included Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a prominent Trump supporter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many state GOP leaders seem eager for that reunification. Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard noted that her state’s convention theme is “United We Stand.” Cruz may have beaten Trump in the state in March, but Pollard says she’s all in for the mogul now. In fact, Pollard said she volunteered in March to be a pro-Trump delegate to Cleveland to underscore the important of reuniting. “I wanted to send a clear signal back in March that we support all of our candidates,” she said. “No matter who our nominee is, we would support them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Oklahoma’s convention gala on Friday night will also feature a keynote address from Cruz’s former running mate, Carly Fiorina. Fiorina was enlisted to speak long before Cruz selected her to be his vice presidential candidate, but her remarks haven’t been vetted yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I have not spoken to Mrs. Fiorina about what her message will be,” said Pollard. “She knows the theme of our convention and I know, number one, that she’s a professional, she’s a lady and she is out for the best interests of the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Nebraska, where Trump – running unopposed this week – still lost 40 percent of the vote, Cruz’s campaign chairman, state Sen. John Murante, told POLITICO that there’s still an element of hardcore support for Cruz among the state’s GOP leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There will be a time to unite behind the Republican nominee. The general election is light years away,” he said, noting that he may not decide whether to support Trump until October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s unclear who will represent the Trump campaign in Nebraska. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, the head of the Republican Governors Association, is the keynote speaker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Essmann, chairman of the Montana GOP, said the lack of a nomination fight has sapped enthusiasm at his state’s convention this weekend. He said he had spoken to Cruz twice about appearing as a keynote speaker Friday night, but their talks have gone “radio silent” since Cruz quit the race after losing Indiana last week. He says he’s still appealing to the Trump campaign for a surrogate to address the convention, and he noted that Trump is sending three staffers to build relationships with Montana’s GOP leaders. Essmann said it would be valuable for Trump himself to reach out to the local party members, who aren’t as hostile to him as Washington Republicans, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Every state party in the nation would benefit from a Republican base that’s excited and activated. There is a role for him to play in helping to get the base excited and activated,” Essman said. “I think that’s still quite possible. I know there’s some heartburn in certain circles in DC about him, but I sense a considerably less of that at the local level.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s Texas where Trump is putting the most on the line. Steve Munisteri, the former chairman of the Texas GOP, said Cruz’s allies have not overtly lobbied for delegates yet – they’re not distributing slates of favored candidates. Rather, they appear to be angling to install about two dozen of the senator’s top backers into the 155-member delegation, while letting the rest play out organically – knowing that most Texas convention delegates are his natural allies anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s advisers, Munisteri added, have been low-key so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re there with olive branches,” he said. “Cruz has tremendous support in the state, so they’re not there to rub anybody’s noses in it. They’re there to introduce themselves and start working on party unity issues. They would like to get some of their delegates.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Munisteri noted that the lack of drama in the presidential nominating fight appears to have sapped enthusiasm for the convention altogether. Thousands of prospective state delegates have called to say they’re skipping the event. ||||| Sen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Ted Cruz is now undeniably the national leader of the conservative movement, and so I expect him to sound like that,\" said JoAnn Fleming, an East Texas activist who served as the Texas Tea Party chairwoman of Cruz's campaign. \"The hardest part for a leader is when the troops have been disappointed and in some ways demoralized, how do you get them back on their feet again?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After his speech, Cruz is scheduled to headline an event with his wife Heidi and Gov.

Will Hurd, running for re-election in a perennial swing district, have suggested they are not yet ready to get behind Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even among those now supporting Trump, there is a reluctance to offer a full-throated endorsement, especially with feelings still raw from Trump's clashes with Cruz in the presidential race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an email to supporters last week, Trump's Texas campaign made a plea for unity heading into the convention — and urged respect for the many Texas Republicans who tried to put Cruz in the White House. \"Let us do so humbly, without unwarranted contentiousness or competition and forever guard against faction, as advised by our Founders,\" wrote Joshua Jones, Trump's Texas director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We need to have unity,\" said Barbara Mabray, a Trump supporter from Georgetown who plans to attend the convention.

Tom Mechler, who became interim chairman after Steve Munisteri stepped down last year, is being challenged by Jared Woodfill, the former chairman of the Harris County GOP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whereas Mechler was elected by the 62-member State Republican Executive Committee last year, he now faces a wider vote by the thousands of delegates to Dallas.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The store employees, in their signature orange aprons, crowded around the entrance of their Salt Lake City location -- waiting to give the Dilley family, the best Christmas they've had in a long time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This year the chain launched its first, 'Gift of Good' campaign, a national web-driven campaign to find the most deserving military family to be awarded with the home repair certificate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This program was inspired by the spirit of giving during the holidays and we thought the most meaningful gift to give is simply helping out a neighbor in need,\" said Home Depot spokeswoman Nicole Carriere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A group of \"do-it-yourself\" and military bloggers took to the web to find a deserving family, Carriere explained. The web-experts narrowed down the military families, relying on a network of diaries, personal accounts and social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group was made up of bloggers \"who we've worked with previously, or who we thought would be interested based on the topics they covered,\" Carriere said. \"Many of them hadn't met in person or didn't follow each other before the program and it was great for us to watch them build friendships with each other and form their own mini-community around the program.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The web-experts took months to narrow down the military families, all deserving. They even interviewed local media, peeked into personal networks and looked to other bloggers. The bloggers, one of them an Atlanta resident, told Carriere the decision was incredibly tough but they settled on SSgt. Kevin Dilley, his wife Tyrena and their five kids. Dilley has been overseas three times to Iraq and Afghanistan and right now he's deployed to Greenland near the Arctic Circle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While he is a world away Tyrena is at home with their kids. Two of their children have spina bifida, a developmental disorder when some vertebrae overlying the spinal cord are not fully formed and remain open. Both kids are in wheel chairs and have undergone multiple surgeries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are very positive, upbeat and humble people – the last people who would ever ask for anyone to do anything for them,\" Carriere said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The family lives in an older home in need of a lot of renovation.

{"context": "When big brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé started introducing their own lines of lightly flavored sparkling water two years ago, the plan was to capitalize on increasing demand for carbonated drinks without calories or chemicals. The sparkling water segment was expanding, so it should've been an easy win. But there was one problem: Everyone was already drinking LaCroix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The generic-looking brand of sparkling water has found a loyal following among young, health-conscious consumers. Comedian Joe Mande of the sitcom Parks and Recreation started a Twitter campaign trumpeting the wonders of LaCroix in hopes of getting the company to make him an official sponsor (they didn’t—and things got weird). In March, the New York Times Magazine published a love letter to the drink. In July, Gizmodo featured it in a series of cocktail recipes, complete with LaCroix illustrations by an artist in Portland, Ore. LaCroix sales since last year have increased 45 percent, to an estimated $120 million—not including sales at independent stores, says Jeffrey Klineman, editor-in-chief of BevNet, a publication that covers the beverage industry. LaCroix’s true sales are closer to $175 million, Klineman says. On Instagram, fans of the drink are posting pictures of their refrigerators packed with cans of LaCroix and such captions as, “At what point do you admit you have a problem?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A photo posted by @hotdogfoodblog on Jul 28, 2015 at 5:43pm PDT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s less about the taste or whatever,” says Thomas Frank, a 24-year-old who runs a blog about college life, where he wrote about how LaCroix helped him quit his energy drink and soda habit. “It’s more about how it’s an interesting fizzy thing and it can replace soda.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Big soda’s efforts to tap the sparkling water market aren’t doing much to curb LaCroix’s success. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo saw their market share within the water segment of the beverage industry shrink four and 5.5 percent, respectively, from 2010 to 2014—even as they added new products. But National Beverage Corp., which owns LaCroix, saw its market share jump 67 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among a flood of sparkling waters, LaCroix is arguably the ugliest—in a good way. While Pepsi recently redesigned its soda cans to appeal to a younger crowd, and other sparkling waters are sold in slim, sleek packaging, LaCroix fans seem to have gravitated toward the outdated neon cans because they don’t have corporate associations, Klineman says. “I bet most people who drink LaCroix don’t even know what National Beverage is,” he says. “It does have this kind of indie crowd. It’s got that Pabst Blue Ribbon feel to it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The famously tight-lipped National Beverage Corp., which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is known for distancing itself from the image of its brands. A publicly traded company, it’s the fourth-largest soda maker in North America,but doesn’t allow any of its employees to speak for the company—except for Chief Executive Officer Nick Caporella, who says he never gives phone interviews. In keeping with that mandate, Caporella declined to speak on the record for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A photo posted by LaCroix Sparkling Water (@lacroixwater) on Aug 2, 2015 at 12:14pm PDT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company, which bought LaCroix in 1996 just as energy drinks were catching on, seems to have stumbled into at least some of the brand’s success. Since industry data showed that most energy-drink guzzlers were men, National Beverage originally marketed LaCroix as a women’s drink, says Howard Wishner, who led marketing at National Beverage at the time. LaCroix started showing up at women’s sporting events and became a sponsor of Susan G. Komen for the Cure. When it started appearing on the shelves of small grocery co-ops and independent markets, it inadvertently won over a following of young, educated men and women along the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just as National Beverage’s Rip It energy drink once went from being its biggest seller to passé, so too could LaCroix fall out of favor. For now, National Beverage is safeguarding sales by relying on what it calls a proprietary mix of “natural essence,” which it uses to create a number of flavors that competitors don’t offer. It’s also making a more direct appeal to Coke and Pepsi drinkers. The brand’s latest product? Cola-flavored sparkling water. ||||| Regardless of what kind you get, most offer a suspicion of flavor rather than a bracing burst of taste. Fine by me; everything these days seems too sweet or intense for my liking, anyway. Aside from the can, everything about LaCroix is gentle. Even the bubbles are small and frothy rather than spiky — a Vinho Verde, not a cava — making it easy to put away a couple in one sitting, totally guilt-free. That’s because LaCroix is everything-free: sugar, sodium, calorie, preservative. It comes in 12 core flavors, but true LaCroix-heads know that Pamplemousse is the best. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company that originally made the drink was based in La Crosse, Wis., and the brand’s vestigial Midwestern guilelessness collides awkwardly with its European pretensions: “Pamplemousse” instead of “Grapefruit”; a new line of flavors called “Cúrate” (loosely, “cure yourself” en Español). It even has a nutrition ambassador named Barb, who lives in Arizona. Her Twitter bio says she is a “former Bostonian enjoying sunshine 365.” LaCroix also sponsors running teams in places like Plantation, Loxahatchee and Sunrise, Fla. To the extent it has a brand identity, LaCroix is for people who might not be perfect but are proud of their lifestyle choices every day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I recently came to the realization that it had been easily 12 years since I’d strung together more than one or two days of sobriety without having five or six drinks to celebrate. I’d been casually buzzed for over a decade, just like everyone I have ever met who isn’t actively in recovery, and while we’re all doing our best, it did strike me as a little gross. So recently, I quit everything to see if I could do it. I’ve now been totally sober for just over a month, which isn’t exactly a feat of discipline. But in five weeks — without rewards or those crackly bursts of serotonin where the vibe in the room coalesces and people start chattering at one other with renewed interest — you start getting lonely and self-conscious, unsure of whether you get to hang out anymore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This Midwestern seltzer has come to fill the gaps that booze and pot left behind. Now, when I meditate in the morning and set my intentions — promising not to smoke cigarettes or slug pinot grigio at lunch or eat the brick of weed fudge in my fridge, which would only make me eat every last Dorito in my sunshine-­less hell box — I let LaCroix lead me to positive thoughts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaCroix is not as exhilarating as taking ecstasy at Joshua Tree, blanketed by a glittering velveteen sky, but, boy, do I get stoked when I’ve remembered to pack one for the movie theater. And now that I’m free of a constant low-grade hangover, I’m left with a lot of time to just walk around, extra alert. I see all of us now. The truth is, for every dork that buys Sriracha-branded knee socks at Urban Outfitters, there’s a mid-30s lady quaffing crates of flavored soda water because that’s her “thing.” My seltzer fixation broadcasts to the world that I’m getting older and, like everyone in their mid-30s in Los Angeles, on some form of passive diet or detox. It’s stupid, but there is an unmistakable joy when friends spot me by my can and strike up a conversation about how they secretly like Orange the best. They know LaCroixville is a safe space — a tacky community with as much judgment as there are calories. Zip. ||||| NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A can of grapefruit-flavored LaCroix Sparkling Water, called Pamplemousse. (Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years, Americans saw carbonated water as an unnecessarily pricey European extravagance. The leading brand, Perrier, streams from a spring in southern France, often destined for the kinds of upscale restaurants where diners are asked \"sparkling\" or \"still.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But amid a decade-long plunge for sodas, and slowdowns for diet and vitamin-enhanced blends, bubbly water has risen swiftly to become one of America's fastest-growing drinks — and left the country's beverage titans scrambling to catch up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sales of Perrier, San Pellegrino and other fizzy waters have more than doubled over the past five years, to about $1.5 billion, far outpacing the growth of bottled and \"functional\" water, such as Vitaminwater, data from industry researcher Euromonitor show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shifting tides have made millions for small fizzmakers long overshadowed by the soda aisle titans. Sales of LaCroix Sparkling Water, with its rainbow-neon cans, have nearly tripled since 2009, to $175 million, industry data show. Sales of Sparkling Ice, a bubbly advertised as the \"bold side of water,\" exploded from $27 million in 2010 to about $550 million last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Free of calories, sodium and fake sweeteners, the sparkling waters seem to have struck a sweet spot with health-conscious buyers eager to swap out syrupy sodas for the benefits of water but nevertheless bored by the most abundant liquid on earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Consumers still like bubbles, they want carbonation, but they want it in a healthier product,\" said Gary Hemphill, the managing director of research for Beverage Marketing Corp., an industry consulting firm. \"Those products really fit where the consumer wants to be.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sodas, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, remain the king of soft drinks, and Americans drank more than 12 billion gallons of soda last year alone. But soda consumption fell last year for the 10th year in a row amid concerns over its ties to obesity, and industry researcher Beverage Digest says the typical American's cola intake has fallen to its lowest level since 1986. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Low- to no-calorie diet sodas were once a popular replacement, but many of those brands have also fallen flat because of worries over artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, which studies have linked to health risks in animals at high doses. Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi sales crumbled 5 to 6 percent last year, leading their corporate makers to substitute in different sweeteners, such as sucralose and acesulfame potassium, known as Ace K. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even sales of vitamin-enhanced waters, after a brief boom, have slipped in favor of more slimmed-down, \"natural\" waters. Sales of the top-selling bottled water, Vitaminwater, criticized for its sugar content and health claims (Coca-Cola settled a deceptive-advertising lawsuit last year), have fallen 4 percent since 2010, to about $1.4 billion, and are now down 17 percent from its 2008 peak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Americans' bottled-water consumption soared past 10 billion gallons last year, and analysts at Beverage Marketing believe the country could guzzle more bottled water than soda by 2017. Drinkers who switched from bottled water to tap during the recession have been reinvigorated by a recovering economy, and the hype surrounding do-it-yourself carbonation machines, such as SodaStream, has helped fuel the seltzer craze. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To compete, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have doubled down with new lines, such as Dasani Sparkling Water, while further hedging their bets with new brands of energy drinks, artisanal \"craft sodas\" and milk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But carbonated water is astoundingly cheap to make (and easy: just add carbon dioxide and water), allowing the soda giants' smaller rivals to spend more on self-promotion. Sparkling Ice maker Talking Rain, headquartered in Washington state, has invested heavily in advertising, signing basketball star Kevin Durant as a spokesman last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [The soda industry is discovering what the future of Diet Coke looks like (and it isn’t pretty)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brands, such as LaCroix, have also benefited from a level of indie credibility that has long eluded bigger cola companies. In a New York Times Magazine \"letter of recommendation\" in March, writer Mary H. K. Choi copped to being a \"LaCroix-head,\" celebrating its simplicity, nutrition and subtle flavor, even as she laughed over its fashion sense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cans look somehow simultaneously obnoxious and earnest, as if they’re trying to appeal to Canadian ravers,\" Choi wrote. \"The first time I drank LaCroix, I half expected it to be filled with self-tanner. Or Axe body spray.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestlé, the Swiss food giant behind Perrier and San Pellegrino (as well as Kit Kat, Lean Cuisine and Häagen-Dazs), said this year it would launch more flavors of sparkling waters, including a green apple Perrier, and slim down its cans to boost the brand, all while investing as much as $200 million and building seven new U.S. production lines this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the challenge in getting more Americans to pay for healthier bubbles, analysts said, may lie in convincing drinkers to forget the waters' snooty history, especially for those who have grown up with the jolting sweetness and deep tradition of an ice-cold can of Coke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We find that, in terms of consumption and palate education, younger people are not ready to switch to Perrier,\" Muriel Koch, the marketing manager of Perrier parent Nestlé Waters, told industry news service Beverage Daily last year. \"We know that we have much more chance of attracting people in their 30s. These people are more aware of sugar intake, naturalness, and (are) keener to discover new tastes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But LaCroix's Florida-based creator, National Beverage Corp. — leader of mostly unpopular budget drinks, including Faygo, Crystal Bay and Shasta — has fought hard to win over young drinkers, loading its Instagram with millennial hotties enjoying a can of pamplemousse (French for \"grapefruit\") at the beach or after going to the gym. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company's stock (listed as FIZZ) has bloomed 75 percent over the last five years, largely boosted by LaCroix's surprise breakout from its Midwestern roots. (Despite the drink's French facade, LaCroix was first made in Wisconsin.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even the company seems to be surprised by the drink's rapid success, though chairman and chief executive Nick Caporella, in a rambling letter to investors, seemed to know why: \"Authenticity in a beverage is . . . and All-ways will be . . . Sparkling Pure (Innocent) Water!\" ||||| We need to talk about your drinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know you think you’ve got it under control, that you can quit any time you want, that it’s not a problem. But I’ve seen you around town — at bars and cafés in the evenings, stumbling down the street with a drink in your hand in the middle of the day. I’ve been to your house and I’ve seen the empty cans piled high, spilling over the sides of the paper Safeway bag you use as a recycling bin. I’ve seen the half-full drinks on every end table, the well-stocked mini-fridge in the closet you refer to as your “office.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You drink too much, is what I’m saying, and for your sake — for everyone’s sake, really — it’s time we had a conversation about your La Croix habit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR La Croix, the carbonated water in a can, is having a moment. If you’ve never tried it — which seems frankly impossible in the Year of the Can — know that it tastes a lot like water, but … better. It’s heavily carbonated and has just a hint of fruit, with flavors like lemon, lime, apricot, and “pamplemousse,” a popular favorite otherwise known to plebeians as “grapefruit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cans themselves are both charming and hideous, as though they were airbrushed at a state fair. In a glowing love letter to the beverage in The New York Times Magazine, Mary HK Choi wrote that the cans are “somehow simultaneously obnoxious and earnest, as if they’re trying to appeal to Canadian ravers or the sort of people who have septum piercings and shop at Desigual.” La Croix is like Perrier meets North Florida, and it is an unexpectedly delicious union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR La Croix has been around since 1981, but its boom in popularity is fairly recent. The Washington Post reported that since 2009, sales have tripled to 175 million while soda revenue has plummeted for the past ten years. Is this because Americans are all of a sudden developing more refined tastes, choosing subtle natural flavoring over Takis and Mountain Dew? HA! Not likely. Our national pastimes are watching celebrities fight on Twitter and murdering each other. We are also, however, preoccupied with getting fat — and with no calories and no sugar, La Croix is the perfect alternative to sodas, as well as a fine mixer for booze hounds who like to stay hydrated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alas, the perfect alternative is still imperfect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR La Croix’s so-trashy-it’s-classy cans are made from aluminum, and, according to our very own advice columnist Umbra: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The manufacture of aluminum is resource intensive and uses a stunning amount of energy: an average of 7.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity for each pound of virgin aluminum. Removing bauxite is no environmental picnic, either, what with the open-cast mining, the deforestation, the mud pits, and the building of roads into once-pristine areas.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, aluminum can (and should!) be recycled, which would cut the energy required to manufacture new cans by about 95 percent, according to Umbra. But how much of our waste actually gets recycled, instead of tossed in the garbage because the recycling bin is 15 feet further away? The Container Recycling Institute reports that Americans throw away an average of 425 cans a year, which is twice as many as we recycle. That’s a lot of La Croix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I can hear you protesting — “but I always recycle!” — and yet, a can is still a can. It takes a lot more energy to get that La Croix to you than it does to turn on your tap and drink city water like the rest of us trash. But, there is hope, and the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. So when you get home tonight, I want you to take a good, hard look at your fridge. Now, go look at your recycling. Is it overflowing with acid-washed water cans? Are they strewn around your house? Are there any beside your bed? Are there any inside your bed? You have a La Croix problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I get it — taking an ice-cold La Croix out of your fridge, popping it open, and hearing those little bubbles foam up, it just feels good and right. But if you find yourself sneaking the devil’s water on your lunch breaks, if you’ve suddenly realized that you’re drinking more La Croix than water, if you’re feeling a vague sense of unease and are not sure why — well, it’s time to step back and look at your life. It’s OK to enjoy La Croix occasionally, but is not OK to drink La Croix exclusively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Put down the can and turn on the tap, my friend. It’s time."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Animal Legal Defense Fund in Portland has filed suit against former owner Gwendolyn Vercher, 51, of Cornelius on behalf of the horse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice, an 8-year-old American Quarter Horse, is seeking damages for negligence that left him 300 pounds underweight and afflicted with lice, a skin infection and damaged genitals from severe frostbite, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Washington County Circuit Court. He will require special medical care for the rest of his life, the suit said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice, formerly known as Shadow when he lived with Vercher, was removed from the Cornelius property in March 2017 and now lives at a horse rescue in Troutdale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Read the lawsuit] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sarah Hanneken, one of the attorneys representing the horse in the case, said state case law has shown animals have legally protected rights. She said Justice should be allowed to recover the costs of damages for pain and suffering, just as a human victim would. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Oregon legislature clearly established an anti-cruelty statute for the safety and protection of animals,\" she said. \"Victims of crimes can sue their abusers and animals are sentient beings that are recognized as victims under Oregon law. So with that premise, we've come to the conclusion that animals can sue their abusers and we're confident of our stance in this case.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any money received from the lawsuit would go into a trust maintained by the horse's guardian to pay for medical costs, Hanneken said. Justice's medical needs have dampened his prospects of being adopted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vercher was sentenced July 2017 in Washington County Circuit Court to three years of probation for first-degree animal neglect, Oregon court records show. The terms of her probation included not possessing any pets or livestock for five years and completing 96 hours of community service within 12 months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vercher paid a little more than $3,700 in restitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vercher and Kim Mosiman, listed in the lawsuit as Justice's current guardian, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Mosiman is the co-founder of Sound Equine Options, the Troutdale-based horse rescue where Justice now lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other cases around the country of animals suing humans haven't ended in the animals' favor.

Courts ruled the primates didn't have the legal rights of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, a crested macaque used an unattended camera at a reserve in Indonesia to take pictures of himself. A lawsuit was filed on behalf of the monkey by PETA four years later to recoup proceeds gained from the published selfies.

{"context": "UPDATED WITH WARNER BROS. STATEMENT After 7:19AM post This has been in the wind for some time, but Henry Cavill will not be reprising his role as Superman in Warner Bros.’ DC films as others from Justice League such as Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa move forward on their respective superhero features Wonder Woman 1984 and Aquaman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The word has been out that Warner Bros. has been mulling a completely different direction with its Superman canon for some time, even considering casting Michael B. Jordan in the role down the road. But at the present moment a Supergirl movie is the studio’s priority as Deadline exclusively broke back in August. Oren Uziel is working on the Supergirl script. According to DC mythology, the character was a teen when she escaped the doomed planet Krypton along with the infant who grew up as Clark Kent. And at this time, there are no other Superman films in development at DC that would include Cavill. The three DC pics he has starred which were directed by Zack Snyder —Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Justice League– have grossed close to $2.2 billion at the global box office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have a great relationship and great respect for Henry Cavill that continues to remain unchanged. Additionally we have made no current decisions regarding any upcoming Superman films” said a Warner Bros. spokesperson today. The Jersey, Channel Islands native also starred in Warner’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. outside the Superman pics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cavill we have confirmed could not make a cameo in New Line’s Shazam! and that was due to scheduling conflicts on Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Similar to Cavill, there’s been heavy buzz that Ben Affleck will not be moving forward as Batman in Matt Reeves’ reboot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warner Bros.’ DC has been focusing on its makeover in the wake of Justice League‘s underperformance at the box office. The feature was expected to be the pinnacle in the DC cinematic universe but fell way short of a $1 billion at the global B.O. with $657.9M; well under Wonder Woman ($821.8M) which broke records for a female-driven live-action property and Batman v. Superman ($873.6M). In the wake of Justice League, Warners promoted New Line’s horror production guru Walter Hamada to President of DC Films, as Warner Bros co-president of production Jon Berg, who was overseeing DC pics, segued out of his role to become Roy Lee’s producing partner on the lot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Upcoming for Warner Bros./DC is Aquaman on Dec. 21, Shazam! on April 5, 2019; Todd Phillips’ The Joker on Oct. 4, and Wonder Woman 1984 on Nov. 1, 2019. ||||| Talks broke down for a cameo in 'Shazam!' due to scheduling conflicts, and the door is now closing on other potential appearances for the actor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DC cinematic universe appears to be losing its Man of Steel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry Cavill, who has played Superman in three films, is parting ways with Warner Bros., sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. The British actor, who first donned the blue suit for 2013's Man of Steel, and then starred in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and last year's Justice League, is said to be hanging up the red cape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warners had been trying to enlist Cavill, who most recently co-starred in Mission: Impossible — Fallout, for a Superman cameo in Shazam!, which stars Zachary Levi and will bow April 5. But contract talks between Cavill's WME reps and the studio broke down, and the door is now closing on other potential Superman appearances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's because Warners has shifted its focus to a Supergirl movie, which will be an origin story featuring a teen superheroine. This effectively removes an actor of Cavill's age from the storyline's equation given that Superman, aka Kal-El, would be an infant, according to DC lore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Furthermore, Warners isn't likely to make a solo Superman film for at least several years, according to another source. \"Superman is like James Bond, and after a certain run you have to look at new actors,\" says a studio source. As such, Cavill will join Ben Affleck, who isn't expected to reprise his role for director Matt Reeves' forthcoming Batman stand-alone film, as a hero on the way out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have a great relationship and great respect for Henry Cavill that continues to remain unchanged. Additionally we have made no current decisions regarding any upcoming Superman films,\" read a statement from a Warner Bros. spokesperson after the initial publication of this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Warners source says the Shazam! deal fell apart because of scheduling conflicts. And that is backed up by the fact that Cavill recently signed on to star in the Netflix series The Witcher. However, another source says that the Witcher commitment came after the Warners impasse, suggesting a change in the studio's strategy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's a recognition that some parts of the previous movies didn't work,\" says the studio insider. Another source says Warners is trying to hit a \"reset\" button with the DC universe, steering its ship slowly into another direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Affleck and Cavill are segueing out, others who were seen together onscreen in Justice League are carrying forward. Gal Gadot is returning for Wonder Woman 1984, set to hit theaters in November 2019; Jason Momoa headlines a solo Aquaman movie this December; and Ezra Miller remains on board to star in a Flash movie, which is due to shoot in early 2019. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara and Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich are looking to reinvigorate the studio's DC Universe, which is still playing second fiddle to the Marvel Universe in terms of box office and critical acclaim. Just six years ago, when The Dark Knight Rises closed out the Christopher Nolan trilogy, DC was the superhero team with the mojo. But so far, only Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman spinoff has lived up to the promise of the franchise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Warners hasn't done is wiped the slate clean in one fell swoop, something that is nigh impossible to do given the years of planning that goes into these films. When asked about the studio at an investor conference on Sept. 6, new WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey said, \"Hats off to Kevin and Toby and their team.\" But he also took a shot at DC. \"Some of our franchises, in particular at DC, we all think we can do better.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A version of this story appears in the Sept. 12 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sept. 12, 12:50 p.m. Updated with a revised statement from a Warner Bros. spokesperson. ||||| As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Deadline and Variety, Henry Cavill is no longer playing Clark Kent/Superman in Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc.’s DC Films franchise. To be honest, presuming this all pans out, this has been expected for quite some time. Cavill was reportedly demanding a movie star’s salary to play a role that, to be fair, can be played by any number of actors. As soon as WB announced that they were planning a Supergirl movie, well, I think we all saw the writing on the wall. There are two takeaways from this. First, as noted on Monday, Warner Bros. is in a place of strength to the point where they don’t need to stress themselves out over the DC Films series. Second, eventual recasting notwithstanding, the franchise as it stands now doesn’t really need a Superman, or a Batman for that matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, Henry Cavill will presumably join Ben Affleck in the “former DC warriors” club, as it’s all but certain that a new actor will take over for Affleck in Matt Reeves’ Batman movie. There were attempts to get Cavill to do a cameo in Shazam, but that fell through. To be fair, Cavill is a busy guy, having just signed on as the lead for Netflix’s The Witcher and having won acclaim for his supporting role in Mission: Impossible – Fallout. That film became somewhat infamous due to the mustache that Cavill wore which he (or, specifically, Paramount/Viacom Inc.) refused to shave off for Justice League reshoots. Having now seen both films, it’s clear which project meant more to the actor. And since, oh my, Fallout made more than Justice League worldwide, Cavill doesn’t really need Superman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nor does the world (or at least DC Films) doesn’t need a Superman at this juncture. We can all imagine hypothetical what-if scenarios. What if WB had pressed ahead with a Man of Steel 2 with a more conventionally heroic Superman with (allegedly) appearances from Supergirl and Brainiac? What if Warner Bros. just retconned the third act of Man of Steel so that only a few dozen people perished at the end (don’t try to convince me that only 76 civilians perished in the third act of The Avengers)? What if Zack Snyder got to make the Justice League movie that he wanted to make? But, come what may, the state of DC Films today is one where Wonder Woman, not Superman, is playing the role usually occupied by the Man of Steel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is ironic that DC Films series is now kept afloat not by Batman and Superman but by Wonder Woman and (presumably) Aquaman. This may be a blessing in disguise. The MCU became a juggernaut partially because it initially didn’t have access to Spider-Man or the X-Men. They had to take their B- or C-level characters (Iron Man, Thor, etc.) and turn them into A-level movie stars. Marvel was arguably a final nail in the coffin of the conventional movie star system (for now, anyway). As a pioneering franchise which saw popular characters hopping from movie to movie, they created a scenario where the character, not the actor, was the equivalent of a “movie star.” Mark Ruffalo isn’t a movie star, but his Hulk is a movie star put to good use in Thor: Ragnarok. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we saw with Justice League (which sold fewer tickets than Hugh Jackman's R-rated Logan), the Superman as he exists in this universe is not a “movie star.” Superman may just be one of those well-known pop culture icons who folks like without necessarily salivating over the prospect of a movie. In that sense, Superman is, relatively speaking, King Arthur, Tarzan or Peter Pan. So, Henry Cavill had little leverage in terms of playing financial hardball, and WB was smart enough to realize that Supergirl was a bigger “movie star” in 2018 than was Superman. If Warner Bros. can make the likes of Wonder Woman, Shazam or Harley Quinn into DC Films “movie stars,” they won’t be reliant on the Dark Knight or the Man of Steel. That will be how they approximate Marvel’s success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To the extent that DC Films wants to match the relative success of the MCU, it won’t be in making movies that flirt with $1 billion worldwide. It’ll be in making movies based on B or C-level characters that are good enough and crowd-pleasing enough to make the DC Films versions of those characters into A-level movie stars. That’s what Marvel did with the likes of Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy. And that is, quite frankly, what Greg Berlanti’s “Arrow-Verse” did on the CW with the likes of Green Arrow, The Atom and Black Lightning. If they can make Zachary Levi’s Shazam or Jason Momoa’s Aquaman into popular favorites on par with Thor or the Hulk and continue to build Wonder Woman into their equivalent of Captain America, then that will be how they win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cavill is a fine actor and I will defend all three of his DC Films performances, but his version of Superman failed to become a “movie star.” There is a rich irony in Cavill playing an anti-Ethan Hunt against Tom Cruise in the last Mission: Impossible considering Hunt is played as essentially a real-world version of Superman both in deeds (all those stunts) and philosophy (“zero body count”). But under this scenario, Superman, as he exists in the DC Films universe, is damaged goods. If Warner can take less obviously popular characters and turn them into audience favorites, then they will win no matter how the respective box office totals compare to Marvel’s post-Avengers successes. Thanks to the likes of Gal Gadot and (presumably) Jason Momoa, the world doesn’t need a Superman (or a Batman)."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A mysterious mummy that languished in German collections for more than a century is that of an Incan woman killed by blunt-force trauma to the head, new research reveals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new analysis shows that the mummy was once an Incan woman who also suffered from a parasitic disease that thickens the heart and intestinal walls, raising the possibility that she was killed in a ritual murder because she was already on the brink of death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mystery mummy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story began in the 1890s, when Princess Therese of Bavaria acquired two mummies during a trip to South America. One was soon lost, but the other somehow made its way to the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich. [See Images of the Murdered Incan Mummy] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bombings and geographic moves destroyed any documentation of the mummy, so little was known about its origin, said study co-author Andreas Nerlich, a paleopathologist at Munich University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To learn more about the enigmatic remains, Nerlich and his colleagues put the mummy through a computed tomography (CT) scanner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the outside, the mummy's head looked fairly normal, but the frontal bones of the skull were completely destroyed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She must have received a couple of really severe hits by a sharp object to her skull just before her death,\" which killed her, Nerlich told Live Science. \"The skull bones that had been destroyed fell into her brain cavity, and they are still there today,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the woman died, she was buried shallowly, likely in the bone-dry Atacama Desert, where the parched sand and air quickly sucked all the fluids out of her body, halting decomposition and naturally mummifying her, Nerlich said. [In Photos: The 10 Driest Places on Earth] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incan life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several lines of evidence point to the woman's Incan origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had the characteristic skull deformation associated with Incan head flattening and skull bone structures found in South American populations but not European ones. Scientific testing revealed that the woman lived sometime between A.D. 1451 and 1642. The mummy was also wearing hair bands made from alpaca or llama hair — another indication of her South American origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Different foods contain different proportions of carbon and nitrogen isotopes (atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons), so the ratio of these two isotopes in the mummy's hair revealed her origins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on those isotopes, the woman likely lived near the coastline in what is now Peru or Chile, and ate a diet high in seafood and maize, a New World crop, Nerlich said. She was between 20 and 25 years old when she died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ritual murder? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any theories about why the woman died violently are highly speculative, Nerlich said. Combined with a DNA analysis of parasites taken from rectal tissue, the CT scan results suggest that from infancy, the woman suffered from Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. As a result, she probably had trouble with breathing and digestion, Nerlich said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility is that she was killed in a ritual murder, just as other Incan mummies were. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She might have been chosen as a victim for a ritual murder, because she was so ill and it might have been clear that she might have lived only for a relatively short period,\" Nerlich said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings on the mummy, which will be on exhibit at the Archaeological Collection of the State of Bavaria in Munich until mid-August, were published today (Feb. 26) in the journal PLOS ONE.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of scientists analysed the skull to find evidence of a blunt trauma to the head, suggesting she died very quickly from the blow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DNA analysis also revealed she suffered from a parasitic infection called Chagas disease, they write in Plos One. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her symptoms indicated she would not have lived for much longer even if she had escaped her killers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chagas is still endemic in South America - especially those living in poverty - and can be deadly if not treated early. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andreas Nerlich, co-author of the study from Munich University, Germany, said that the girl was likely to have come from a poor family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The parasite lives in mud-brick walls typical of those from lower social classes, not in stone houses or better equipped, cleaner surroundings,\" he told BBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For more than 100 years, it was unclear where the mummy was from, but now detailed CT scans, injury reconstructions and DNA evidence have finally given clues to her origin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Andreas Nerlich NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mummified woman is over 500 years old, and would have died in her early 20s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She is thought to have arrived in Germany after a Bavarian princess brought her back from an expedition to South America in 1898. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where exactly she would have lived remains unclear, but based on a stable isotope analysis of her bones and hair, her diet was rich in fish. The researchers therefore suggest she lived near the Peruvian or Northern Chilean coast line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rope which tied her plaits was made out of material that originated in South America and her skull formation was also typical of the Inca people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was killed and buried in a hot and dry sandy region that resulted in natural mummification. For many years, however, it was simply assumed she was a German bog body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We assumed she died in a ritual killing but we have no clear evidence from written sources,\" explained Prof Nerlich.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence of ritual sacrifice in South American mummies is well documented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Incan empire, young girls were often given up to the sun god in religious rituals. The parents and local communities of sacrificed victims were consequently highly respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Emma Brown from the department of archaeological sciences at the University of Bradford, UK, who was not involved with the study, said that due to the lack of contextual data it was hard to definitively say that the mummy was a human sacrifice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This individual is older than the usual profile of ritually killed females, who are typically around the age of 13 or 14,\" Dr Brown told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is important to recognise the historical context of this mummy. The radiocarbon dates cover the period of the Spanish conquest of the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Historical records describe repressive and extreme forms of violence and recent bio-archaeological investigations of conquest-era cemeteries have revealed that many types of trauma, including massive blunt force cranial trauma [shown here] are quite common,\" she added."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keziah Daum, an 18-year-old senior at Woods Cross High School, Utah, received backlash after she posted photos of her dressed in a red qipao, a traditional Chinese dress, on prom night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After she posted them online, many on Twitter were quick to criticize her choice of wardrobe, accusing her of appropriating the Chinese culture, given she is not of Chinese descent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the first criticisms came from a Chinese American student who shared Daum’s post on Twitter with the caption “My culture is NOT your g------ prom dress,” pointing out the origins of qipao and its significance within a marginalized minority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience, is parallel to colonial ideology,” the student wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The post has since been retweeted over 41,000 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Techmeyer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daum told ABC News she bought the dress at a vintage store downtown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As soon as I saw the dress I knew it was the one,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, she said, she was only focused on the modesty and subtle elegance of the dress. She said she was not aware of the cultural context that’s deeply embedded with the garment’s history, one that can be traced back to the 17th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Shortly after I got the dress, I decided to do some research,” Daum said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a quick search, she found that the qipao, or cheongsam (in Cantonese), came with a rich background and learned how it eventually became a symbol for female empowerment, which Daum said made her “love it even more.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On prom night, Daum said she received compliments from everyone, including her friends, advisers, fellow students she has never met and even waiters at the restaurant they ate at that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then at work a few days later, the backlash started pouring in, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I wasn’t expecting it at all,\" Daum said. \"My intention was never to cause any commotion or misunderstanding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Techmeyer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people online are calling her actions thoughtless and even reprehensible, while others are jumping to her defense. But for many, the real offense Daum committed was when she posed in a group photo crouching down with their hands folded in front of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, when asked about the group photo, Daum told ABC News the gesture was referring to “Papa Bless,” a pose inspired by Ethan Klein from h3h3 Productions, a popular Israeli-American comedy YouTube channel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At the time we were deciding on silly pictures, someone suggested those poses, so I just followed the crowd,” Daum said, “I see where [the critics] were coming from, but I don’t think they really got the full context.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Techmeyer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She insists there was no racial undertone intended, adding, “I want to everyone to know that I respect the Chinese culture and every culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daum’s story has quickly gained traction, even making its way overseas to some Chinese publications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One online Chinese newspaper, The South China Morning Post, quoted people in Mainland China who seemed supportive, with some even calling it “cultural appreciation” instead of appropriation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked if she regretted her decision, Daum said no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I would wear it again,” Daum said, adding, \"I never imagined a simple rite of passage such as a prom would cause a discussion reaching many parts of the world. Perhaps it is an important discussion we need to have.” ||||| Tweet with a location NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) Prom dresses are designed to get reactions, and the history of social media is littered with viral prom outfits -- dresses made out of unusual materials , dresses that send statements and dresses that are, well, regrettable, to say the least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the viral reaction 18-year-old Keziah Daum has sparked with her prom dress is shocking, in no small part because of its disproportionate intensity. Her decision to wear a Chinese outfit called (depending on your dialect) a qipao or a cheongsam to prom in Utah, despite having no Chinese ancestry -- and then tweeting pictures of her posing with friends at prom - - has launched a social media debate around cultural appropriation that's generated hundreds of thousands of posts and comments, many of them outraged, and some of them outrageous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As she said to Buzzfeed, \"I never imagined a simple rite of passage such as a prom would cause a discussion reaching many parts of the world,\" Daum said. \"Perhaps it is an important discussion we need to have.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She's right on that point: Cultural appropriation is a real and serious concern that's deeply intertwined with issues like colonialism, labor theft, racial privilege and ethnic stereotyping. Dismissal of the phenomenon is often simply a knee-jerk reaction by those seeking to assail what they see as \"political correctness.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as always with these discussions, it pays to consider context before opening fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is it inherently appropriative for a non-Chinese person to wear Chinese-style apparel? The answer is: It depends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is the person wearing it as part of an attempt at racial aping, mockery or stereotyping ( see: every Halloween ever )? Is the clothing itself an inappropriate variation of attire that's worn for culturally essentialist or religious purposes (example: conical peasant hats or anything with the Buddha stamped on i t)? Is the outfit being worn to an event whose theme uses Asian aesthetics in the service of white establishment privilege (e.g. , so many museum galas)? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And what, for that matter, are the actual origins of the garment in question? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the qipao, especially in its contemporary form, is far from a \"traditional\" Chinese outfit. In fact, it historically wasn't \"female\" clothing at all — or even \"Chinese.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outfit that became the qipao, the sijigiyan, was the traditional ethnic clothing of the Manchu, who took over China in 1644 and established their own Qing Dynasty as its rulers. In the process, they mandated that all adult Chinese men in service of the throne wear Manchu garb -- turning the loose-fitting straight-line sijigiyan, known in Mandarin Chinese as the changpao, into both a symbol of elite status and a stamp of absolute Manchu domination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually, the practice of wearing changpao became common even among non-Manchurian Chinese men who weren't part of the government. But non-Manchurian Chinese women continued to wear typical Chinese outfits -- usually blouses and long skirts under loose coats or jackets -- until the Qing Dynasty fell in 1911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the 1930s, in colonial Shanghai and Hong Kong, the traditional Manchu male outfit had become feminized and stylized: The long gown was cut short and shaped to fit women's curves, elaborately printed or embroidered and turned into the dress commonly referred to as the qipao. Today, Chinese women who aren't restaurant staff or flight attendants do not wear the modern version of the qipao -- skin-tight, with a revealing leg slit and a hemline above the knee -- for anything other than weddings and gala events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Bruno Mars accused of cultural appropriation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bruno Mars accused of cultural appropriation 02:10 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which brings us back to Keziah Daum's decision to wear a qipao to her prom. She clearly didn't consider the full implications of her decision to not just wear the dress, but to post pictures of herself doing so on social media without explanation. And her comments to the press make it apparent that she hasn't fully reflected on the way that wearing outfits or hairstyles associated with other cultures is itself an expression of privilege. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in all fairness, her critics may actually be less knowledgeable about the dress than she is -- after all, Daum has referenced the qipao's association with female empowerment as one of the reasons she chose to wear it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More importantly, those who have chosen to conduct a social-media pile-on of Daum rather than engage her in civil conversation forget that she's a teenager -- one whose interest in other cultures could easily be turned into respect, mutual exchange and positive engagement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Though the cultural context of Asians who live in a majority-Asian societies, versus Asian Americans who live as minorities in the US, is quite different, it's worth noting that Chinese in China have largely stepped up to defend Daum's wearing of the dress as a valid homage and celebration.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, cultural appropriation is something we need to discuss. But any \"discussion\" that involves thousands of strangers attacking a teen from the safety of distance and anonymity looks a lot like cyberbullying. What's more, the incessant flame wars around Daum have prompted those on the extreme right to use her as a symbol to advance their agenda of cultural erasure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like prom dresses, posts on social media are designed to draw attention. But let's remember that, like prom dresses, when they go wrong, the results can be ... regrettable."}

He owned a team of racers, barreled through the skies in more than 120 competitions, and worked as a stunt pilot in several films. He was brawny and handsome; only some salt and peppering on his temples gave a hint of his 74 years.Leeward's most recent obsession was the \"Galloping Ghost,\" a World War II -era P-51 Mustang fighter he and friends retrofitted for racing.He excitedly trumpeted the work that had been done on the Galloping Ghost to prepare it for the National Championship Air Races held in Reno. \"She's rested but hungry,\" his website said. \"The [reins] are coming off and she's coming out of the stable…. How fast will she go? Hold on tight, you'll find out soon enough.\"On Friday, Leeward crashed while piloting that plane during a high-speed race in Reno. Leeward was killed, as were spectators on the ground. Scores of others suffered injuries, some of them critical.Leeward's family members witnessed the crash, said Reno Championship Air Races President and Chief Executive Mike Houghton.\"They obviously are devastated,\" he said at a televised Reno news conference. \"His wife wanted me to know that Jimmy would not want us to cancel the races.\" Leeward's pilot's medical records were up-to-date, and he was \"a very qualified, very experienced pilot,\" Houghton said. He'd been racing at the event in Reno since 1975.News of the crash and Leeward's death left the fervent airplane racing community stunned and deeply saddened. \"Everybody knows him. It's a tight-knit family,\" Houghton said. \"He's been here for a long, long time.\"Hundreds of people posted messages on Leeward's Facebook page.\"RIP Jimmy,\" one read. \"He left this world with his boots on doing what he loved.\"Some angrily questioned why man his age was racing planes. \"What the hell was he doing up there over a public venue?\" one asked.Fans at the race said it appeared that Leeward tried to steer the plane away from the stands where spectators were sitting. It is unclear what caused the crash, although officials said initial reports may indicate a mechanical failure.Leeward ran Leeward Air Ranch in Ocala , Fla., described on its website as a \"500-acre private, gated pilot's paradise\" where fliers can \"experience the freedom of flying far from the restrictive airspace of the big city.\" He left little doubt that he relished the speed and challenge of racing in a class of planes that commonly exceeded 450 mph. It was no hobby for him. He wanted to win.\"Welcome to the Big League. The 'serious toys for big boys' club,\" read his website. \"You need massive horsepower, a tricked-out airframe, and a great pilot to get past it.…No margin for error here!

{"context": "WASHINGTON — In the face of a storm of controversy and a slew of challengers, U.S. Rep. Blake Farenthold indicated Monday he's still running for re-election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This time around, it will likely be a lonely battle for the Corpus Christi Republican. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's lonelier than it's been in past times, but he's not alone,\" said Farenthold's chief of staff, Bob Haueter, on Monday evening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farenthold found himself at the center of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 1 when Politico reported that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit using $84,000 in taxpayer funds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farenthold fiercely denies the accusations, both in public and in private, and he quickly pledged to pay back the $84,000 involved in the settlement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue initially faded away in 2014 after the settlement and after the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, an advisory arm of the House, recommended the member-driven U.S. House Ethics Committee dismiss the charges against Farenthold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy continued to dog him after the U.S. House Ethics Committee announced recently that it would give the allegations a closer examination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then on Friday, the Houston Chronicle reported that Farenthold and his entire congressional staff underwent sexual harassment training in 2016 after the he was accused of gender discrimination. And late Monday, The New York Times published fresh accounts culled from former staffers and legal documents describing Farenthold's office as a \"hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All this sets the stage for the fight of Farenthold's career. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Five Republicans have launched bids to unseat Farenthold in his 27th Congressional district, most prominently former Texas Water Development Board chairman Bech Bruun, who resigned from that post and filed to run as a Republican for the congressional seat Friday. Others include Michael Cloud, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and former chairman of the Victoria County GOP. On the Democratic side, at least four Democrats have lined up for potential campaigns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats are candid about the seat being out of reach for them, meaning Farenthold’s biggest hurdle is in the GOP primary. The crowded field increases the odds of a runoff, and a rule of thumb in Texas politics is that it is near-impossible for an incumbent to survive the second round of a primary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farenthold's political troubles come amid — and in large part due to — an environment of increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct in Washington, D.C. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two female Republican members from out of state, U.S. Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia, have called on Farenthold to not just retire but resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats last week purged two favorites from their ranks: U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. John Conyers of Michigan announced their resignations. Franken did so in a highly reluctant matter, suggesting he was a sacrificial lamb to allow Democrats to attain the moral high ground on the issue of sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liberals then quickly made Farenthold the poster boy of alleged harassment, and they demanded he resign. Failing that, they urged GOP leadership to push him out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But leading Republicans — and Texas delegation members — remained silent. Democrats were quick to construe that as tacit approval of Farenthold's alleged behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews with a dozen or so delegation insiders, they say it is a different story behind the scenes. Texas Republican members would prefer for Farenthold to step aside (he has until Tuesday to withdraw, but there are few signs he intends to do so). At the same time, there is little interest in publicly knifing him — that’s just not how things are done in the tight-knit delegation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, if a new and credible allegation surfaces, Farenthold could see the political ground swiftly shift underneath him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most Texas Republican operatives predict his fundraising will dry up amid the bad publicity, and it’s unlikely GOP colleagues will rush to donate to his campaign, the common practice when a longtime incumbent is in political trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite all of those developments, Farenthold’s close advisers are sticking with him, and there is a clear sense of ire within his inner circle that the Office of Congressional Ethics' investigation and dismissal recommendation did not put the story to rest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A group of past and current employees circulated a letter defending Farenthold, describing him as having “always treated us fairly and with dignity and respect.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he has the support of a prominent figure in Texas state politics: pollster Chris Wilson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We wouldn’t work for someone who has been demonstrated to abuse women,” Wilson said. “But an accusation, especially one that has already been investigated, doesn’t make him guilty.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I sat down with the congressman, his wife and his staff and after learning more about the process undertaken by the Office of Congressional Ethics, I agree with the OCE’s findings that the charges were unfounded,” he added. “And I’m proud to be part of his re-election effort as I believe Farenthold to be an honorable man.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cassandra Pollock and Patrick Svitek contributed to this report.

Farenthold acknowledges gender discrimination complaints by two more women 1 / 59 Back to Gallery NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON –Embattled Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, under fire in an ongoing sexual harassment probe, said Friday that he and his entire congressional staff underwent sensitivity and sexual harassment training last year after two female staffers complained of gender discrimination and \"sexualized commentary\" in his Capitol Hill office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women's complaints in 2016 followed that of former spokeswoman Lauren Greene, who had recently settled a federal lawsuit that accused Farenthold of sexual harassment and of firing her in retaliation for her complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ICON OUT: Conyers resigns from Congress amid claims NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new revelations, which Farenthold acknowledged to the Chronicle on Friday, bring to at least three the number of women who have complained of either sexual harassment, gender discrimination, or a hostile work environment in his office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Playing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farenthold, a four-term congressman from Corpus Christi, has denied any wrongdoing in any of the cases, which come at a time when concerns about the treatment of women have exploded in Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Farenthold admitted no wrongdoing in Greene's case, he settled the lawsuit out of court in late 2015 for $84,000 - using taxpayer funds that he has recently said he will repay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite his pledge, Farenthold has begun to hear murmurs about stepping down, including from fellow Republican Mia Love of Utah. \"This is about people taking responsibility for what they do and changing the culture in Washington,\" she said on CNN Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland called for Farenthold's resignation Friday. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, also said on Fox News Friday that Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three other members of Congress have announced plans to quit this week in response to sexual harassment allegations: Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite Farenthold's decision to pay the settlement with his own money, he still has maintained that he did nothing wrong and that Greene was fired for \"poor performance.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greene's lawyer, meanwhile, said Friday that she has agreed for the first time to fully cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which reopened an investigation this week into her 2014 complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until now, Greene had sought to avoid working with the panel, saying she wanted to get on with her life after her 2015 confidential settlement with Farenthold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SCATHING: Internet goes wild with Sen. Al Franken resignation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Citing new revelations, the Ethics Committee announced Thursday that it is extending its probe into Greene's original allegations, which have laid dormant in the two years since the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farenthold has relied on the OCE's recommendation that the Ethics Committee drop Greene's case after investigators said in 2015 that they found no \"substantial reason to believe\" that the congressman had engaged in any wrongdoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ethics Committee, however, has kept the case open, though not actively under investigation until now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't believe the OCE's recommendation not to continue the case was a judgment on the ultimate merits of Ms. Greene's claims,\" said her Washington lawyer, Les Alderman. One proof of that, he added, is the Ethics panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After details of their $84,000 taxpayer-funded settlement came to light last week, both Farenthold and Greene have called for greater public transparency in their dispute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Farenthold, 55, has since been hit with a new public account from another former spokeswoman, Elizabeth Peace, who left his office last March. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Peace came to Farenthold's office after Greene had left, she provided a similar account of a hostile and sexualized work environment. Neither accused Farenthold of improper sexual contact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her lawsuit, Greene, then 27, painted a picture of a socially awkward, hard-drinking, middle-aged man who reportedly had \"sexual fantasies\" and \"wet dreams\" about her. She also accused his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of regularly belitting and humiliating her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peace, a former television news anchor, told the Chronicle in an interview this week that even after Greene had left, Farenthold \"allowed the hostility in his office to continue. He allowed us to work in a place that was just emotionally damaging, and that should never be allowed in any office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peace, now 37, said that while Farenthold didn't sexually harass her directly, \"his comments were inappropriate and his unwillingness to immediately take action to allow us to work in a safe environment is inappropriate.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incidents of abusive behavior were not uncommon, according to another woman, former college intern Olivia de la Peña, who worked in Farenthold's office in the fall of 2015. Peña, now 23, said she experienced no sexually inappropriate behavior in the office, but instead learned to navigate what she called the congressman's \"anger issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she once received an angry call from Farenthold about a travel mix-up that reduced her and the congressman's scheduler to tears. She said Farenthold later apologized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about Peace's account, Farenthold's office provided a statement recounting that two unnamed women complained separately to the congressman sometime in 2016 about allegedly discriminatory treatment they received in the office, particularly from Haueter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Farenthold's office, the first woman brought forward her complaint of inappropriate behavior and gender-based treatment, saying Haueter treated her \"differently.\" Then another woman came forward to report that the first woman had herself engaged in \"inappropriate sexualized commentary in the workplace.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chronicle has confirmed that the second woman was Peace. The other woman, reached by the Chronicle, declined to confirm her involvement, saying she had \"nothing to add.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to the complaints, Farenthold said he brought in an \"independent investigative team\" to address the two women's concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The investigation resulted in the first complaining employee admitting that her problem with Mr. Haueter was based on a personality conflict, and not any gender bias,\" Farenthold's current communications director, Stacey Daniels, said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"With regard to the second complaint, the investigators did not find corroboration of the alleged sexualized comments attributed to the complaining employee,\" Daniels said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daniels said that the outside investigators determined that \"there was no evidence of gender bias, or inappropriate sexualized comments by office personnel.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite that conclusion, she said Farenthold and the entire office staff took sensitivity and anti-harassment training to ensure \"full compliance with office policy and the law.\" ||||| WASHINGTON — When Lauren Greene, a former communications director for Representative Blake Farenthold, sued him claiming sexual harassment, among her complaints was that he “disclosed that a female lobbyist had propositioned him for ‘a threesome.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Farenthold, in legal documents, said that Ms. Greene had it wrong. The woman wasn’t a lobbyist, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As allegations of sexual misconduct rock Capitol Hill — three lawmakers announced their resignations last week alone — Mr. Farenthold, Republican of Texas, stands out as the survivor. He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an $84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A peek into the inner workings of his office reveals the kind of hostile work environment, rife with sexual innuendo, that prompted Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, to call Congress “the worst” place for women to work."}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The left-hander had to come up with new ways of playing chords, and also tuned down his guitar to a darker, lower tone to make bending the strings easier. The resulting menacing sound spawned the heavy metal genre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Band members came and went, though Iommi, Osbourne, Butler and Ward remained the classic line-up.

I'm not doing it again.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US-based Osbourne, dubbed the Prince of Darkness, admitted his emotions were \"all over the place\" since returning home for the final shows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since I've got to this building, I've been happy, I've been tearful,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One of the proudest things I have in my heart is the fact that Black Sabbath wasn't a band that was created by some big mogul,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was four guys who said, 'Let's have a dream', and it came true beyond our wildest expectations.\""}
