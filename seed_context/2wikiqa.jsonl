{"context": "Lehi-Nephi\nIn the Book of Mormon, the land of Lehi -Nephi( also referred to as the land of Nephi) is the homeland of the Nephites in the early times of the Book of Mormon. The land is later conquered by the Lamanites, and the remaining Nephites flee to the land of Zarahemla, home of the Mulekites. In later years, an expedition under Zeniff returns to Lehi-Nephi to recolonize the area, and at first, the Lamanites allow them to settle. Zeniff, his son Noah, and Noah's son Limhi rule as kings over their people in the land of Lehi -Nephi. Ultimately the Nephite settlers leave the land of Nephi because of Lamanite oppression. They are led by Ammon, the leader of a party sent by king Mosiah son of king Benjamin to learn the fate of Zeniff's group. They return to Zarahemla as refugees. According to the Book of Mormon, the land of Nephi was south of and at higher elevation than Zarahemla. A strip of wilderness running east and west divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla. In the 1st century BC, the lands of Nephi and Zarahemla were bordered on the east and on the west by bodies of water that were called respectively\" the east sea\" and\" the west sea.\" There is no unequivocal indication in the Book of Mormon that the seas were intended to represent oceans, but the term\" lake\" is not used in the Book of Mormon to describe an inland body of water, and a parallel is seen between the American Promised Land of the Book of Mormon and the Biblical Promised Land, which is bordered by inland seas. The book of Mosiah in the Book of Mormon tells of a search party that was sent out from the land of Nephi to find the land of Zarahemla. Traveling northward in\" a land among many waters,\" in the general vicinity of the Book of Mormon land Cumorah, the search party mistakenly supposes that it has found the land of Zarahemla.\n\nBack to Front (Caravan album)\nBack to Front is the 1982 album released by Caravan. \" Back to Front\" featured the original lineup of Richard Coughlan, Pye Hastings, Richard Sinclair and David Sinclair after 1971's\" In the Land of Grey and Pink\" and would be the last album to feature that lineup.\n\nIf I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You\nIf I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You is the second album by Canterbury Scene band Caravan, released in September 1970.

It was produced by David Hitchcock and was the last album to feature the original lineup of Richard Coughlan, Pye Hastings, Richard Sinclair and Dave Sinclair until 1982's\" Back to Front\". The album was written and recorded during late 1970 and early 1971, and featured more material from Richard Sinclair. Hastings, who had been the main songwriter on the previous two releases, contributed only one track. Instrumentally, the music is dominated by David Sinclair's keyboard solos, and side two is taken up by a 22- minute suite of songs,\" Nine Feet Underground\". The cover features a Tolkien- influenced painting. The album was critically well received but was not a chart success, which led to frustration within the band and David Sinclair's departure. Nevertheless, it has remained in print and sold steadily, and been recommended by critics as a good introduction to the Canterbury Scene genre.

Antionum also bordered on the seashore, apparently to the east of the land. The name Antionum was given the land by the Zoramites who gathered and settled the area. When Alma and his brethren went to the land to preach to the Zoramites they were surprised to find that the Zoramites had built synagogues and astonished at their unusual form of worship. Those who believed in the words of Alma and his missionary companions were cast out of the land and went north to the land of Jershon to live among the people of Ammon, the Lamanite converts. The Zoramites eventually allied with the Lamanites in an attempt to overthrow the Nephite government( as had done Amlici). The combined Zoramite/ Lamanite army gathered in the land Antionum as the Nephites gathered in the land of Jershon. In large part due to inferior defensive technology, the Lamanites were afraid to face the Nephites at that juncture, so they departed the land of Antionum into the wilderness, toward the land of Manti where a battle ensued. The hill Onidah was located in the land of Antionum and was the site where Alma and Amulek taught the Zoramite poor.\n\nAlbum Number 2\nAlbum# 2 – also known as The Outsiders Album# 2 or simply# 2 – is the second studio album by the Outsiders.\n\n"}

She began performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several films.

The song also won the 1962 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The song has been covered by many other artists. It became the theme song for Andy Williams, who first recorded it in 1962 (and performed it at the Academy Awards ceremony that year). He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each episode of his eponymous television show and named his production company and venue in Branson, Missouri, after it; his autobiography is called Moon River\" and Me\". Williams' version was never released as a single, but it charted as an LP track that he recorded for Columbia on a hit album of 1962, \"Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes\". The song's success was responsible for relaunching Mercer's career as a songwriter, which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll had replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time. The song's popularity is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people's memories of popular songs. Comments about the lyrics have noted that they are particularly reminiscent of Mercer's youth in the Southern United States and his longing to expand his horizons.

The song was also often used as the first song of Cheap Trick concerts, and as a result was the first song on the band's seminal live album \"Cheap Trick at Budokan\". \"Hello There\" is a frantic, energetic, raucous hard rock song. As performed on \"In Color\", the song starts with Nielsen playing a frenzied, fuzzy guitar part for two and a half bars, then Bun E. Carlos' strong drum beat appears, and finally Tom Petersson's bass and Robin Zander's vocal join in. The entire song lasts 1 minute and 41 seconds. Annie Zaleski of Ultimate Classic Rock described it as having \"razor-edge riffs, a frenzied drum solo and ragged exhortations of \"Would you like to do a number with me?\" Cheap Trick also released the song on its compilation albums \"Sex, America, Cheap Trick\" and \"The Essential Cheap Trick\". A live video of Cheap Trick performing \"Hello There\" at the Budokan concert was shown on the DVD included with the 30th anniversary collector's edition release of \"Cheap Trick at Budokan\" album. Critic Dave Marsh of \"Rolling Stone\" detected echoes in the song of the \"manic verve\" of The Beatles' song \"Birthday\".

John M. Borack listed the song one of 20 Cheap Trick songs to die for and said of the song that \"it's quick, it's kick ass and it's a perfect set opener. \" Zaleski rated it as the #8 all-time Cheap Trick song and described the live version from \"Cheap Trick at Budokan\" as \"the sound of a band exploding into its own\" and \"that it \"perfectly captures the band’s transformation from a cult act into rock superstars.\" Nielsen has stated that he wrote the song because in its early days the band did not always get a soundcheck before it played live. Rather than use one of their more melodic songs to experiment with the sound coming out of the PA system, they could use this song, which Nielsen called a \"perfect welcome to the show intro piece.\" Nielsen said he got the idea for such an intro song from an earlier band, Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera. \"Hello There\" replaced \"ELO Kiddies\" as Cheap Trick's live opening song. It was the band's typical live opener from 1977 through the mid-1980s. Music critic Bryan Wawzenek described it as \"the best concert opener in rock and roll.\" \"Hello There\" was covered by Foetus on their 1996 album \"Boil\". It was also covered by Phil Lewis in 2000. Cheap Trick's version was also included on the soundtrack to the Matt Dillon film \"Over the Edge\", along with the Cheap Trick songs \" SurrenderDowned\" and \"Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace.\" A version of \"Hello There\" is also included in the music video game \"Rock Band 2\" as a playable track.\n\nCheap Trick\nCheap Trick is an American rock band from Rockford, Illinois, formed in 1973.

He was the son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and 4th Duke of Lennox, and of the Royalist commander Lord Bernard Stewart. Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Collège de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War.\nGeorge Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montjuïc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.\n\nCharles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond\nCharles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox KG( 7 March 1639 December 1672) was the only son of George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Katherine Howard, daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. He was the grandson of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox. On 10 December 1645 he was created Baron Stuart of Newbury, Berkshire, and Earl of Lichfield, titles conferred on him\" to perpetuate the titles which were intended to have been conferred on his uncle\" Lord Bernard Stewart, youngest son of the Duke of Lennox, who had been killed in the Battle of Rowton Heath in the English Civil War in September of that year. In January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods. Charles Stewart married, firstly, Elizabeth Rogers, after June 1659. He married, secondly, Margaret Banaster( widow of William Lewis) on 31 March 1662. He married, thirdly, Frances Teresa Stewart, granddaughter of Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre, in March 1667. This last marriage was famous, as Frances Stewart, known at court as\" Le Belle Stuart\" had been desired by Richmond's cousin, King Charles II, as a mistress. Charles Stewart returned to England with Charles II in 1660, and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10- year- old cousin Esmé Stewart on 10 August 1660, Charles Stewart succeeded as third Duke of Richmond and sixth Duke of Lennox. In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord- Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter. On the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made lord lieutenant and vice admiral of Kent jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea. In 1671 he was sent as ambassador to the Danish court to persuade Denmark to join England and France in a projected attack on the Dutch. While there he died( by drowning) in 1672, aged 33 at Elsinore, without issue, and his titles became extinct, with the exception of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey. The titles Duke of Richmond, Duke of Lennox and Earl of March, were resurrected for Charles II's illegitimate son by Louise de Kérouaille, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, in 1675.\n\nKatherine Stuart\nKatherine Stuart( died 1650) was an English noblewoman and Royalist supporter during the English Civil War. She married her first husband George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny, against the wishes of both King Charles I and her parents. George commanded a regiment for the king in the opening stages of the war and was killed at the Battle of Edgehill. Katherine used a visit to London, ostensibly to deal with her husband's estate, to clandestinely pass messages to Royalists in the city. After her discovery she was imprisoned in the Tower of London before being released by the intervention of the French ambassador. Katherine married James Livingston in 1648 and the pair unsuccessfully attempted to release the king from parliament's captivity during his journey to trial. After the king's execution, the couple fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.\n\nLord Bernard Stewart\nLord Bernard Stewart( 1623 – 26 September 1645) was a Scottish aristocrat who served as a Royalist commander in the English Civil War. He was the youngest of the five sons of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond. Lord Bernard was to be created Earl of Lichfield by King Charles I for his actions at the first and second battles of Newbury and Naseby but died of injuries received leading a sortie against besieging Parliamentary forces in the Battle of Rowton Heath in September 1645, before the patent could be implemented. The titles of Baron Newbury and Earl of Lichfield were instead created in December 1645 for his six- year- old nephew, Charles Stewart( 1639 – 1672), the son of Bernard's elder brother George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny, who had been killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642.

This is the fifth movie in Warner Bros.' series of\" Gold Digger\" films, following the now lost films\" The Gold Diggers\"( 1923) and\" Gold Diggers of Broadway\"( 1929), as well as a remake of the earlier film\" Gold Diggers of 1933\"( which was the first to feature Busby Berkeley's extravagant production numbers) and\" Gold Diggers of 1935\". The film was followed by\" Gold Diggers in Paris\"( 1938).\n\nGold Diggers of Broadway\nGold Diggers of Broadway is a 1929 American Pre-Code musical comedy film directed by Roy Del Ruth and starring Winnie Lightner and Nick Lucas. Distributed by Warner Bros., the film is the second two-color Technicolor all-talking feature-length film (after \"On with the Show!\", also released that year by Warner Bros). \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" was also the third film released by Warner Bros. to be shot in color; the first was a black-and-white, part-color musical, \"The Desert Song\" (1929). \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" became a box office sensation, making Winnie Lightner a worldwide star and boosting guitarist crooner Nick Lucas to further fame as he sang two songs that became 20th-century standards: \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" and \"Painting the Clouds with Sunshine.\" Based on the 1919 play \"The Gold Diggers\" – which was also turned into a silent film of the same name in 1923 — now lost, \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\" utilized Technicolor, showgirls, and sound as its main selling points. It earned a domestic gross of $3.5 million, extending to over $5 million worldwide (approximately $ today). The original production cost was approximately $500,000. It was chosen as one of the ten best films of 1929 by \"Film Daily\". As with many early Technicolor films, no complete print survives, although the last twenty minutes do, but are missing a bridging sequence and the last minute of the film. Contemporary reviews, the soundtrack and the surviving footage suggest that the film was a fast-moving comedy which was enhanced by Technicolor and a set of lively and popular songs. It encapsulates the spirit of the flapper era, giving us a glimpse of a world about to be changed by the Great Depression. Because the film is considered a partially lost film since 1970s, the loose remake, \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", is the most frequently seen version of the story.\n\nThe Gold Diggers (1923 film)\nThe Gold Diggers is a lost Warner Bros. silent comedy film directed by Harry Beaumont with screenplay by Grant Carpenter based on the play\" The Gold Diggers\" by Avery Hopwood which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920. Both the play and the film were produced by David Belasco. The film stars Hope Hampton, Wyndham Standing, and Louise Fazenda. It was also the( uncredited) film debut of Louise Beavers. The story of\" The Gold Diggers\" was filmed again as a talkie in 1929 as\" Gold Diggers of Broadway\", which is now lost, and also in 1933 as\" Gold Diggers of 1933\", with musical numbers created by Busby Berkeley. Three other sequels followed:\" Gold Diggers of 1935\"( 1935),\" Gold Diggers of 1937\"( 1936), and\" Gold Diggers in Paris\"( 1938).\n\n"}

The film was adapted by Hugh Williams and Margaret Vyner from the play of the same name which they had written and found success with in London's West End.\n\nStanley Donen\nStanley Donen (April 13, 1924 – February 21, 2019) was an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are \"On the Town\" (1949) and \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952), both of which starred Gene Kelly who co-directed. His other films include \"Royal Wedding\" (1951), \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" (1954), \"Funny Face\" (1957), \"Indiscreet\" (1958), and \"Charade\" (1963). He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. From 1943, he was in Hollywood and worked as a choreographer before beginning to collaborate with Kelly. After \"On the Town\", Donen worked as a contract director for MGM under producer Arthur Freed producing critically well-received box-office hits. Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical \"Singin' in the Rain\", released in April 1952, which has appeared on lists of the best films ever made. Donen's relationship with Kelly deteriorated during their final collaboration, \"It's Always Fair Weather\" (1955). He then broke his contract with MGM to become an independent producer in 1957. He continued making films throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, often financial successes that gained positive attention. His film output became less frequent in the early 1980s and he briefly returned to the stage as a director in the 1990s and again in 2002. Donen is credited with having transitioned Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals – such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley – were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers were part of a stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he was doing was a \"direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals ... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch ... What \"we\" did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal.\" Donen is highly respected by film historians; however his career is often compared to Kelly's, and there is debate over who deserves more credit for their collaborations. Donen and Kelly's relationship was complicated, both professionally and personally, but Donen's films as a solo director are generally better regarded by critics than Kelly's. French film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical \"outshines anybody else's, including Vincente Minnelli's\". David Quinlan called him \"the King of the Hollywood musicals\". Among his awards are an Honorary Academy Award in 1998 and a Career Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival in 2004. Donen married five times and had three children. Film director and comedian Elaine May was his partner from 1999 until his death in 2019. He was the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nGrassella Oliphant\nGrassella Oliphant( September 1, 1929 in Pittsburgh – December 16, 2017) was an American jazz drummer.

He released two soul jazz albums as a leader on Atlantic Records in the 1960s. \" The Grass Roots\", released in 1965, saw Oliphant working with saxophonist Harold Ousley, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, and bassist Ray McKinney. His 1968 release\" The Grass Is Greener\" featured John Patton on organ, Grant Green on guitar, Clark Terry on trumpet, and Major Holley on bass, in addition to Ousley. \" The Grass Is Greener\" has been repeatedly sampled by hip hop artists. Both albums were reissued on CD by Collectables Records as a single disc in 2005. After an almost 40- years hiatus from music, working as the manager of a golf course, Oliphant resumed playing in the 2000s, this time in the New Jersey area.

After leaving the band in 1970, Reed released twenty solo studio albums. His second, \"Transformer\" (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought mainstream recognition. After \"Transformer\", the less commercial \"Berlin\" reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\" (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and \"Sally Can't Dance\" (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with \"New Sensations\" (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album \"New York\". Reed participated in the reformation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled \"Songs for Drella\" which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. \" Magic and Loss\" (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6. He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled \"The Raven\". He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album \"Lulu\" with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease.

{"context": "Symphony No. 2\nSymphony No. 2 may refer to:\n\nRichard Strauss\nRichard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 – 8 September 1949) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, and violinist. Considered a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras, he has been described as a successor of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Along with Gustav Mahler, he represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. Strauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with tone poems and operas. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was \"Don Juan\" (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including \"Death and Transfiguration\" (1890), \"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\" (1895), \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" (1896), \"Don Quixote\" (1897), \"Ein Heldenleben\" (1898), \"Symphonia Domestica\" (1905), and \"An Alpine Symphony\" (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was \"Salome\" (1905) which used a libretto by Hedwig Lachmann that was a German translation of the French play \"Salomé\" by Oscar Wilde. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal: \"Elektra\" (1909), \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1911), \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" (1912, rev. 1916), \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" (1919), \"Die ägyptische Helena\" (1928), and \"Arabella\" (1933). His last operas, \"Daphne\" (1938), \"Friedenstag\" (1938), \"Die Liebe der Danae\" (1940) and \"Capriccio\" (1942) used libretti written by Joseph Gregor, the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, lieder (especially his \"Four Last Songs\" from 1948), the Violin Concerto in D minor (1882), the Horn Concerto No. 1 (1883), Horn Concerto No. 2 (1943), his Oboe Concerto and other instrumental works such as \"Metamorphosen\" (1945). Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of Hans von Bülow , Strauss began his conducting career as Bülow's assistant with the Meiningen Court Orchestra in 1883. After Bülow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the Bavarian State Opera where he worked as third conductor from 1886–1889. He then served as principal conductor of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar from 1889–1894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" with his wife, soprano Pauline de Ahna, singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894–1898, after which he was principal conductor of the Berlin State Opera from 1898–1913. From 1919–1924 he was principal conductor of the Vienna State Opera, and in 1920 he co-founded the Salzburg Festival. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally. In 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of Nazi Germany: head of the Reichsmusikkammer and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor Arturo Toscanini had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [née von Hermannswörth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera \"Die schweigsame Frau\" (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera \"Friedenstag\", which premiered just before the outbreak of World War II, was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in Nazi concentration camps. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a denazification tribunal in Munich.\n\nSymphony No. 5\nSymphony No. 5 may refer to:\n\nSymphony No. 8\nSymphony No. 8 may refer to:\n\nSymphony No. 1\nSymphony No. 1 may refer to:\n\nSymphony No. 3\nSymphony No. 3 may refer to:\n\nSymphony No. 9\nSymphony No. 9 may refer to:\n\nSymphony No. 1 (Strauss)\nRichard Strauss composed his Symphony No. 1 in D minor (TrV 94) in 1880 when he was just 16 years old.

The Best Of\" in 1997. \" You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart\" peaked at number 4 in Ireland, number 19 in Finland and number 42 in the UK.

It reached No. 2 in both Ireland and Australia.\n\nYou Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\n\"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\" is a popular song from the year 1913 written by James V. Monaco with the lyrics being written by Joseph McCarthy. It was introduced by Al Jolson in the Broadway revue \"The Honeymoon Express\" (1913) and used in the 1973 revival of the musical \"Irene\". One of the earliest singers to record the song was Al Jolson. His rendition was recorded on June 4, 1913. It was released on Columbia A-1374 and was an international hit. In Britain, Columbia had to order 25,000 copies from the U.S. to satisfy unprecedented demand for a gramophone record. Another successful recording in 1913 was by William J. Halley. Al Jolson recorded the song again on March 20, 1946 and it was released on Decca 23613. Jolson also performed the song on the soundtrack of the 1946 film \"The Jolson Story.\" Roger Edens wrote additional lyrics to the song for Judy Garland. The new lyrics cast Garland in the role of a teenage fan of Clark Gable. Garland sang the song to Gable at a birthday party thrown for him by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM executives were so charmed by her rendition that she and the song were added to the film \"Broadway Melody of 1938\". Garland recorded the \"Gable\" version on September 24, 1937. It was released on Decca 1463. MGM released the song as a b-side in 1939, opposite Garland's recording of \"Over the Rainbow\" for \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nJudy Garland\nJudy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969) was an American actress, singer and dancer. During a career that spanned 45 years, she attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist, and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received an Academy Juvenile Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Special Tony Award. In 1962, Garland won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her 1961 double LP live recording \"Judy at Carnegie Hall\"—the first woman to win in this category. She is considered by many to be one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century. Garland began performing in vaudeville as a child with her two elder sisters and was later signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM, and is best remembered for her portrayal of Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly and regularly collaborated with director and second husband Vincente Minnelli. Some of her film appearances during this period include roles in \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (1944), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), and \"Summer Stock\" (1950). Garland was released from MGM in 1950, after 15 years with the studio, amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract. Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed performances came late in her career: she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the 10 greatest female stars of classic American cinema. Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from her teens onward; her self-image was influenced and constantly criticized by film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive. Those same executives manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as financial instability; she often owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Her lifelong addiction to drugs, including alcohol, ultimately led to her death in London from an accidental barbiturate overdose at age 47.\n\nYou Made Me Believe in Magic\n\" You Made Me Believe in Magic\" is the title of a 1977 international hit single by the Bay City Rollers, taken from their album\" It's a Game\". The recording, a mid-tempo disco-styled pop tune featuring strings and horns, had its greatest impact in North America, where it was issued as the album's lead single in May 1977 to reach number 10 on the US Hot 100 in\" Billboard\" magazine that August. \" You Made Me Believe in Magic\" was the Bay City Rollers' third US Top 10 hit; the follow- up single\" The Way I Feel Tonight\"(# 25) would mark the group's final Hot 100 appearance. Outside the US,\" You Made Me Believe in Magic\" was typically issued as its parent album's second single, serving as a less successful followup to the\" It's a Game\" single: this was true in Australia( No. 36), Germany( No. 25), New Zealand( No. 39) and the UK( No. 34), where\" You Made Me Believe in Magic\" was the Bay City Rollers' twelfth and final chart hit. In Canada, however, the song enjoyed its greatest international popularity, where it peaked at number five, and ranks as the 68th greatest hit of 1977.\n\nLet Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\n\" Let Me Love You( Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Ne- Yo, taken from his fifth studio album,\" R.E.D.\"( 2012).

A music video directed by Christopher Simms sees Ne- Yo\" channeling\" Michael Jackson in his dance moves, as well as showing off a toned physique. The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. Outside the United States,\" Let Me Love You( Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\" topped the charts in the United Kingdom and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Japan and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nJoseph McCarthy (lyricist)\nJoseph McCarthy ( September 27, 1885 – December 18, 1943) was an American lyricist whose most famous songs include\" You Made Me Love You\", and\" I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\", from the now- forgotten\" Oh, Look!\"( 1918), starring the Dolly Sisters, based upon the haunting melody from the middle section of Chopin's Fantaisie- Impromptu. Born in the Massachusetts city of Somerville, McCarthy was a frequent collaborator of composers Harry Tierney( 1890 – 1965) and Fred Fisher( 1875 – 1942). He was the director of ASCAP from 1921 to 1929.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do\n\" Look What You Made Me Do\" is a song recorded by American singer- songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 25, 2017, by Big Machine Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album\" Reputation\"( 2017). Swift wrote and produced the song with her co-producer Jack Antonoff. \" Look What You Made Me Do\" is an electroclash and dance- pop song, with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation. Right Said Fred band members are also credited as songwriters, as it interpolates the melody of their song\" I'm Too Sexy\"( 1991). The song broke a string of records, including the record for the most plays in a single day on Spotify. Commercially,\" Look What You Made Me Do\" has topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Scotland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has also received Platinum certifications in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden and the United States. It also received Diamond certification in Brazil.

She became Princess of Wales as the wife of Edward of Westminster (only son and heir apparent of King Henry VI) and then Queen of England as the wife of King Richard III. As a member of the powerful House of Neville, she played a critical part in the Wars of the Roses fought between the House of York and House of Lancaster for the English crown. Her father Warwick betrothed her as a girl to Edward, Prince of Wales, the son of Henry VI. The marriage was to seal an alliance to the House of Lancaster and halt the civil war between the two houses of Lancaster and York. After the death of Prince Edward, she married Richard, Duke of Gloucester, younger brother of King Edward IV and of George, Duke of Clarence, the husband of Anne's elder sister Isabel Neville. Anne became queen when Richard III ascended the throne in June 1483, following the declaration that Edward IV's children by Elizabeth Woodville were illegitimate. Anne Neville predeceased her husband by five months, dying in March 1485. Her only child was Edward of Middleham, who predeceased her.\n\nGuillaume Wittouck\nGuillaume Wittouck( 1749- 1829) was a Belgian lawyer and High Magistrate.

The eldest son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, he became Earl of Warwick through marriage, and was the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with political connections that went beyond the country's borders. One of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses, originally on the Yorkist side but later switching to the Lancastrian side, he was instrumental in the deposition of two kings, which led to his epithet of \"Kingmaker\". Through fortunes of marriage and inheritance, Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally, he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict, he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly in the years to come. The political conflict later turned into full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick's father Salisbury. York's son, however, later triumphed with Warwick's assistance, and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick's support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king's choice of Elizabeth Woodville as his wife. After a failed plot to crown Edward's brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived, however: on 14 April 1471, Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed. Warwick's historical legacy has been a matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.\n\nLyon Cohen\nLyon Cohen( 1868–1937) was a Polish- born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist.

Stonbely( born December 7, 1945) is an American advertising entrepreneur and civic leader known for his work and advocacy in New York's Times Square. Born in 1945 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York, George N. Stonbely graduated from New York University in 1967. While still in college, he first volunteered then worked as a legislative researcher for Robert F. Kennedy, who was the United States Senator from New York at the time. Stonbely worked briefly in sales promotion and advertising for the\" New York Times\", then in 1975, he founded Spectacolor, Inc., an advertising company that pioneered the first full- color, computer- programmed, changeable message billboard. This groundbreaking innovation introduced the concept of selling\" time\" on billboards, rather than the customary practice of selling\" space\", a change that would pave the way for outdoor advertising to become a multibillion- dollar industry. The first Spectacolor sign was installed at One Times Square, the building from which the world- famous Times Square Ball is dropped every New Year's Eve. Eventually more than 60 Spectacolor signs( including static signs, video displays, and 3 D spectacular signs) were installed in Times Square, along with more than 50 Spectacolor systems in 30 cities in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and across the United States. In 1984, Spectacolor was chosen by the Marriott Corporation to develop the premiere signage on its new Marriott Marquis Hotel, the first of the developments that led to the rebirth of Times Square that began in the 1980s. The flagship sign, the Eastman Kodak Company's\" Kodarama\" display, signaled the return of corporate America to Times Square for the first time since the end of World War II. Soon Kodak was joined by Hertz, AT&T, JVC, Chock Full o' Nuts, Maxwell House Coffee Company, Planters Peanuts, and Wrigley, to name a few of the iconic brands that helped reestablish a mainstream marketing presence in Times Square. By 2000, Spectacolor was the world leader in spectacular advertising, operating in over 30 cities around the globe. That year, Stonbely partnered with Arizona entrepreneur Karl Eller and Clear Channel Communications to form Clear Channel Spectacolor, which he sold to Clear Channel in 2006. A long- time Times Square advocate, Stonbely is a founding director of the Times Square Alliance and serves on the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee. He is also active in numerous international and local charitable organizations, including UNICEF, Partnership for a Drug Free America, and the Greater New York Boy Scouts. He serves on the Board of Directors of Inside Broadway and The Town Hall. Upon his death in 1999, legendary outdoor advertising designer Douglas Leigh willed Stonbely his famous lighted snowflake, which has been suspended above the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan every holiday season since 1984. In 2001, Stonbely dedicated the snowflake to UNICEF, for which more than$ 50 million has been raised since the UNICEF Snowflake Ball gala was launched in 2004.\n\nRumbi Katedza\nRumbi Katedza is a Zimbabwean Film Producer and Director who was born on 17 January 1974.\n\nDan Kaplan (architect)\nDaniel J.

She was trained as a power generation engineer at Tsinghua University.\n\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nLi Peng\nLi Peng (20 October 1928 – 22 July 2019) was a Chinese politician. Known in Western media as the \"Butcher of Beijing\" for his role in the Tiananmen Square Massacre, Li served as the fourth Premier of the People's Republic of China from 1987 to 1998, and as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, from 1998 to 2003. For much of the 1990s Li was ranked second in the Communist Party of China (CPC) hierarchy behind then Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. He retained his seat on the CPC Politburo Standing Committee until his retirement in 2002. Li was the son of an early Communist revolutionary, Li Shuoxun, who was executed by the Kuomintang. After meeting Zhou Enlai in Sichuan, Li was raised by Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao. Li trained to be an engineer in the USSR and worked at an important national power company after returning to China. He escaped the political turmoil of the 1950s, '60s and '70s due to his political connections and his employment in the company. After Deng Xiaoping became China's leader in the late 1970s, Li took a number of increasingly important and powerful political positions, eventually becoming premier in 1987. As Premier, Li was the most visible representative of China's government who backed the use of force to quell the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

Andromachus was the son of Achaeus who was a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Anatolia. His family was influential in Anatolia and had strong royal connections. Andromachus had three siblings; one brother: Alexander and two sisters: Antiochis and Laodice I. Andromachus was the father of Achaeus and his sister Laodice II was married to the Seleucid King Seleucus II Callinicus. As a result of this marriage, the future Seleucid kings, Seleucus III Ceraunus and Antiochus III the Great, were his nephews. During the course of a war between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, the Egyptian king Ptolemy III Euergetes took Andromachus prisoner; and when Ptolemy III died in 221 BC, Andromachus was still a prisoner in Egypt. Since Achaeus was anxious to secure his father's release, Ptolemy IV of Egypt’s chief advisor, Sosibius, regarded the captive nobleman as a very valuable piece to play in the political game. He had, perhaps, before the revolt of Achaeus, tried to strike a bargain with him—the release of Andromachus as the price for Achaeus deserting the Seleucid king. When Achaeus did revolt, pushed by other circumstances, and without having made any compact with Egypt, there was even less reason to let Andromachus go. Sosibius was very unwilling to part with such a valuable individual; but around 220 BC the Rhodians intervened on behalf of Achaeus, changing the situation radically. The Rhodians' decision did not spring from altruism. It was a move with which they hoped to defeat the city-state of Byzantium, with which they were at war. Byzantium hoped to gain Achaeus' support against Rhodes and its allies. By obtaining Andromachus' release the Rhodians planned to foil the Byzantine plan and obtain Achaeus' support. They therefore sent an embassy to Ptolemy IV asking him to deliver Andromachus to them. While Ptolemy at first refused to free Andromachus, with further consideration, being anxious to please the Rhodians, the king yielded to their request and handed over Andromachus to them. This was done, and father and son were reunited. After these events, Andromachus disappears from history.\n\nMona Hopton Bell\nMona Hopton Bell( 1867- 1940) was a British artist, best known for her portraits of civic figures.

The parish was established in 1888 by the Missionary Fathers of St. Charles Borromeo, with the Rev. F. Morelli, C.S.C.B., as its first pastor. It was the first national parish in the United States founded for Italians, who had previously had to worship in the basements of the Catholic churches made up of Irish- American congregants. The total debt of the property was$ 158,000. Because of the increased parish numbers, the Rev. Vincent Jannuzzi, C.S.C.B., founded St. Rocco's Chapel at 18 Catherine Slip as a mission chapel of St. Joachim Parish, as well as the Madonna Day Nursery on Cherry Street, which opened in 1910 and was staffed by the Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine. The 1913-1914 parish statistics listed 1,000 baptisms, 250 marriages and 400 confirmations. The parish had a brief connection with Mother Cabrini, who was helped by the Scalabrini Missionaries upon her arrival in the United States in 1889. The Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, whom she had founded, were the first teachers at the St. Joachim parish school when it was opened. They withdrew from the school in 1892. St. Joachim's was home to the St. Rocco Society, founded in 1889 by immigrants from Potenza. The society's hand crafted statue of St. Rocco from Italy was housed at St. Joachim ’s.

The origin of the word is an adjective meaning\" noblehighborn\". The feminine singular is sharifa( h) or shareefa( h). The masculine plural is Ashraf. From 1201 until 1925, when the Hejaz was conquered by Ibn Saud, this family( the descendants of Hasan ibn Ali) held the office of the Sharif of Mecca, often also carrying the title and office of King of Hejaz. Descendants now rule the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the name is taken from the Banu Hashim, the sub- tribe of Banu Quraish, to which Muhammad belonged. Sunnis in the Arab world reserve the term\" sharif/ sherif or shareef\" for descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, while\" sayyid\" is used for descendants of Husayn ibn Ali, Hasan's younger brother. Both Hasan and Husayn are grandchildren of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, through the marriage of his cousin Ali and his daughter Fatima. However, since the post- Hashemite era began in 1925 after the fall of the Sharif of Mecca, the term\" sayyid\" has been used to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. Shiites use the terms\" sayyid\" and\" habib\" to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. Sayyids having ancestry from both Imams Hasan and Husayn use the terms\" Shareefayn Sayyidayn Sayyid AlShareef,\" or\" Sheikh Assayyid\" before their names and call themselves\" Najeeb AlTarfayn\". In Morocco, several of the regal dynasties have been qualified as\" Sharifian\", being descendants of Muhammad. Today's Alaouite dynasty has made claims to be Sharifian. The Royal Family of Brunei, The Bolkiah Dynasty of Sultans, are also Sharifs through their ancestor Sharif Ali bin Ajlaan bin Rumayytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the Emir of Makkah Sharif Ajlaan and had migrated and settled in Borneo.

{"context": "Enheduanna\nEnheduanna (Sumerian: , also transliterated as \"EnheduanaEn-hedu-ana\", or variants; fl. 23rd century BC) is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded. She was the High Priestess of the goddess Inanna and the moon god Nanna (Sin). She lived in the Sumerian city-state of Ur. Enheduanna's contributions to Sumerian literature, definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the \"Sumerian Temple Hymns\". Further additional texts are ascribed to her. This makes her the first named author in world history. She was the first known woman to hold the title of EN, a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters. Enheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located. She continued to hold office during the reign of Rimush, her brother, when she was involved in some form of political turmoil, expelled, then eventually reinstated as high priestess. Her composition 'The Exaltation of Inanna' or ‘nin me šara’ details her expulsion from Ur and eventual reinstatement. This correlates with 'The Curse of Akkade' in which Naram-Sin, under whom Enheduanna may have also served, is cursed and cast out by Enlil.
