He was born in rural Narrows, Georgia.  Cobb spent 22 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, the last six as the team's player-manager, and finished his career with the Philadelphia Athletics.  In 1936 Cobb received the most votes of any player on the inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, receiving 222 out of a possible 226 votes (98.2%); no other player received a higher percentage of votes until Tom Seaver in 1992.  In 1999, editors at the \"Sporting News\" ranked Ty Cobb 3rd on their list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\".\n\nTodd Helton\nTodd Lynn Helton (born August 20, 1973) is a former American professional baseball first baseman who played his entire 17-year career for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB).  A five-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger, and three-time Gold Glove Award winner, Helton holds the Colorado Rockies club records for hits (2,519), home runs (369), doubles (592), walks (1,335), runs scored (1,401), runs batted in (RBI, with 1,406), games played (2,247), and total bases (4,292), among others.\n\nBob Johnson (outfielder)\nRobert Lee Johnson (November 26, 1905 – July 6, 1982), nicknamed \"Indian Bob\", was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for three American League teams from 1933 to 1945, primarily the Philadelphia Athletics.  He was the fifth player to have nine consecutive seasons of 20 or more home runs, and his 288 career HRs ranked eighth in major league history when he retired.  Usually playing on inferior teams, he batted .300 five times, had eight seasons with 100 runs batted in, and finished his career among the AL's top five right-handed hitters in career RBI (1,283), runs (1,239), slugging average (.506), total bases (3501) and walks (1,075).  He held the Athletics franchise record for career runs from 1942 to 1993.  He also ranked among the AL leaders in games in left field (3rd, 1,592) and outfield putouts (10th, 4,003) and assists (8th, 208) when his career ended.  His elder brother Roy was a major league outfielder from 1929 to 1938.\n\nLave Cross\nLafayette Napoleon Cross (May 12, 1866 – September 6, 1927) was an American third baseman in Major League Baseball who played most of his 21-year career with Philadelphia-based teams in four different leagues.  One of the sport's top all-around players in the years surrounding the turn of the 20th century, when he retired he ranked fifth in major league history in hits (2,644) and runs batted in (1,371), ninth in doubles (411) and total bases (3,466), and third in games played (2,275) and at bats (9,064).  Also starring on defense, after beginning his major league career as a catcher, he led third basemen in fielding percentage five times, and ended his career with nearly every fielding record at that position: games (1,721), putouts (2,306), assists (3,706), total chances (6,406), and fielding average (.938); his 212 double plays ranked third behind Billy Nash and Arlie Latham.  He captained the Philadelphia Athletics teams which captured two of the first five American League pennants.\n\nGus Williams (outfielder)\nAugust Joseph \"Gus\" Williams, Jr. (May 7, 1888 – April 16, 1964), known also as \"Gloomy\" Gus Williams, was a German American professional baseball player whose career spanned 10 seasons, five of which were spent in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the St. Louis Browns (1911–15).  Over his major league career, Williams batted .263 with 171 runs scored, 367 hits, 58 doubles, 31 triples, 12 home runs, 147 runs batted in (RBIs), and 95 stolen bases in 410 games played.  Williams career started out in 1909 with the Monmouth Browns of the Class-D Illinois–Missouri League.  After playing in the minor leagues for two seasons, Williams made his major league debut in 1911.  He had another stint in the majors in 1912.  In 1913, Williams served as the Browns regular outfielder.  He was a dead-ball era power hitter for the Browns, ranking in the top-10 amongst American League hitters in home runs during the 1913 and 1914 seasons.  He led the league in strikeouts in 1914.  Williams would make his last appearance in the major leagues during the 1915 season.  He would go on to play in the minors with the Toronto Maple Leafs (1915), Nashville Volunteers (1916), Louisville Colonels (1917), and Indianapolis Indians (1918).  In the minors, he compiled a career batting average of .293 with 838 hits in 759 games played.  Williams also played semi-professional baseball after leaving the professional circuit.  He batted and threw left-handed.  During his baseball career, Williams stood at 6 ft and weighed 185 lb .\n\nGarret Anderson\nGarret Joseph Anderson (born June 30, 1972) is an American former professional baseball left fielder.

A three-time All-Star, he led the Angels to the 2002 World Series title, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 2003 All-Star Game.\n\n1915 Detroit Tigers season\nThe 1915 Detroit Tigers won a then club-record 100 games and narrowly lost the American League pennant to the Boston Red Sox, who won 101 games.  Though four other Tigers teams have won 100 games (1934, 1961, 1968, and 1984), only the 1934 Tigers had a better winning percentage.  The 1915 Detroit Tigers team is remembered for its all-star outfield of Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, and Bobby Veach—who finished #1, #2, and #3 in the American League in both runs batted in and total bases.  Baseball historian Bill James ranks the Tigers' 1915 outfield as the best in major league history.\n\nGavvy Cravath\nClifford Carlton \"Gavvy\" Cravath (March 23, 1881 – May 23, 1963), also nicknamed \"Cactus\", was an American right fielder and right-handed batter in Major League Baseball who played primarily for the Philadelphia Phillies.  One of the sport's most prolific power hitters of the dead-ball era, in the seven years from 1913 to 1920 he led the National League in home runs six times, in runs batted in, total bases and slugging percentage twice each, and in hits, runs and walks once each.  He led the NL in several offensive categories in 1915 as the Phillies won the first pennant in the team's 33-year history, and he held the team's career home run record from 1917 to 1924.  However, he played his home games at Baker Bowl, a park that was notoriously favorable to batting statistics.  Cravath hit 92 career homers at Baker Bowl while he had 25 homers in all his games away from home.\n\nFrank Thomas (designated hitter)\nFrank Edward Thomas Jr. (born May 27, 1968), nicknamed \"The Big Hurt,\" is an American former first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for three American League (AL) teams from 1990 to 2008, all but the last three years with the Chicago White Sox.  One of the most fearsome and devastating hitters of his era, he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991–1997) with a .300 batting average and at least 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks and 20 home runs; over that period, he batted .330 and averaged 36 home runs and 118 RBI per year.  A perennial MVP candidate through the 1990s, he was named the AL's Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in 1993 after becoming the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs, leading the team to a division title; he repeated as MVP in the strike-shortened 1994 season after batting .353 and leading the league in slugging average and runs.  After two subpar seasons, he lost the MVP in a close vote in 2000 after posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI, also earning AL Comeback Player of the Year honors, as Chicago finished with the AL's best record.\n\nBill Dahlen\nWilliam Frederick Dahlen (January 5, 1870 – December 5, 1950), nicknamed \"Bad Bill\" for his ferocious temperament, was an American shortstop and manager in Major League Baseball who played for four National League teams from 1891 to 1911 .  After twice batting over .350 for the Chicago Colts, he starred on championship teams with the Brooklyn Superbas and the New York Giants.  At the end of his career he held the major league record for career games played (2,443); he ranked second in walks (1,064, behind Billy Hamilton's 1,187) and fifth in at bats (9,033), and was among the top ten in runs batted in (1,234), doubles (414) and extra base hits (661).  He was also among the NL's top seven players in hits (2,461; some sources list totals up to 2,471), runs (1,589), triples (163) and total bases (3,447).  After leading the league in assists four times and double plays three times, he set major league records for career games (2,132), putouts (4,850), assists (7,500), total chances (13,325) and double plays (881) as a shortstop; he still holds the record for total chances, and is second in putouts and fourth in assists.  His 42-game hitting streak in 1894 was a record until 1897 , and remains the fourth longest in history and the longest by a right-handed NL hitter.\n\n"}

{"context": "Minimum metal mine\nA minimum metal mine is a land mine that is designed to use the smallest amount of metal possible in its construction.  Typically, the only metal components are located inside the fuze mechanism which triggers detonation.  Both minimum metal anti-tank and anti-personnel mines exist.  Some designs contain virtually no metal at all e.g. less than a gram.  This is achieved by encasing the explosive charge in a plastic, wooden, or glass body, with metallic components limited to the few small parts in the fuze which can not easily be made from other materials, such as the spring, striker tip, and shear pin.  Minimum metal mines are extremely difficult to detect using conventional metal mine detectors and usually require modern techniques, such as robotic \"Multi Period Sensing\" (MPS) equipment, to identify, but it is still too difficult to find non-metallic mines.  These techniques are usually restricted to well-funded international mine clearing organizations and major militaries, making minimum metal mines especially pernicious where they are encountered.\n\nCopperfields Mine\nCopperfields Mine, originally known as Temagami Mine, is an abandoned copper and silver mine on Temagami Island in Lake Temagami, Ontario, Canada.  The mine opened in 1955 and comprises both underground and surface workings within a sulfide ore body.  Situated in Phyllis Township, the mine produced 34,000,000 dollars Canadian with 80 million pounds of copper, 230,028 ounces of silver and 13,271 ounces of gold.  It was considered to be the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada.  A mill was not initially needed because the ore was 28% copper.  The mine closed in 1972 and is now flooded by water.  Ruins of the Copperfields mill are present as foundations.  It is possible to find mineral specimens in the spoil heaps of the old mine, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, malachite, dolomite, hessite, merenskyite, millerite, palladium, quartz and others.  The Lake Temagami Access Road was created to ship ore from the mine site.\n\nTemagami Island\nTemagami Island, formerly spelt as Timagami Island, is an island in Lake Temagami in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It is the largest island within the lake, with Bear Island coming second.  The island has many hiking trails that lead into the old-growth forest that is a mix of large white and red pine trees.  Temagami Mine, later known as Copperfields Mine, was a copper mine that opened on Temagami Island in 1954.  It was considered to be the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada.  The mine closed in 1972.\n\nMcIntyre Mines\nThe McIntyre mine is an abandoned underground gold mine in Schumacher, Ontario, Canada, which has earned a place in Canadian mining history as one of the nation's most important mines.  Its iconic headframe, located near downtown Timmins, has come to represent the entire Porcupine Gold Rush.  The McIntyre also yielded a considerable amount of copper over its life.\n\nP3 Mk2 mine\nThe P2 Mk2 and P3 Mk2 are Pakistani plastic cased minimum metal anti-tank blast mines.  The P2 Mk2 has a square case with a central circular ribbed pressure plate, the P3 is circular with a central circular pressure plate.  Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines.  The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the pressure plate, when enough pressure is place on the pressure plate of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it.  A yellow canvas carrying strap is normally fitted to the side of the mine.  The mines have a secondary fuse well on the bottom which can be used with anti-handling devices.  A GLM-2 electronic booby trap can be fitted to the cavity under the pressure plate.  The mine is supplied with a steel disc which makes the mine more easily detectable, although this is seldom used.  Since 1997 only a detectable version of the mine has been produced, and to comply with the Convention on Conventional Weapons amended protocol II, Pakistani stocks of the mine are being retrofitted with steel detection discs.  The mines are found in Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Tajikistan.\n\nNational Mine Map Repository\nThe National Mine Map Repository (NMMR) is part of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM).  The NMMR resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, and collects and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of coal mines in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania.  The Green Tree facility provides and stores, digitally and in microfilm (aperture cards), over 182,000 maps of abandoned mines.  This repository contains maps of mine workings from the 1790s to the present day.  It serves as a point of reference for mine maps and other information for both surface and underground mines throughout the United States.  It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency.  The NMMR provides services ranging from retrieving mine related data for economic analysis to assessing the potential risk associated with underground mining.  Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction, and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare.  In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests.\n\nMI AC Disp F1 Minotaur mine\nThe MI AC Disp F1 Minotaur mine is a French scatterable anti-tank mine.  The mines can also be scattered from 155 millimetre artillery shells, which can hold six of the mines.  The mine is cylindrical with two Misznay Schardin effect warheads, one on each side of the mine, with a 600 gram charge.  The warhead is claimed to be able to penetrate 90 mm of armour at a distance of 0.5 m.  It uses a magnetic influence fuze combined with an anti-handling device which arms itself 64 seconds after launch.  At the end of its active life, which is set to between one and 96 hours the mine self-destructs.  The land based scattering system can launch mines to a range of up to 300 m.\n\nMcIntyre Community Building\nThe McIntyre Community Building was constructed in Timmins, Ontario, Canada in 1938 by McIntyre Mines owner J. P. Bickell.  At the time, it was one of the finest recreational centres in Canada outside of a major centre.\n\nAccentor-class minesweeper\nIn World War II, the United States Navy needed a vessel that could consistently locate mines in [foreign or domestic?]  or littoral waters.  Littoral waters are found between the shore line and waters 60 meters deep.  The Accentor-class minesweeper (sometimes called the Accentor/Acme-class minesweeper) was developed for this task.  This class of minesweeper was named after the Accentor bird, Prunella modularis.  This bird is endemic to Europe, Asia, and North Africa which is the area that World War II occurred.  The bird is a drab brown and gray color and is in the same family as warblers and thrushes.  The Accentor-class mine sweeper was designed for the sweeping of mines in harbors, bays, and other littoral waters.  The Accentor-class minesweeper had a wooden hull for three reasons.  The first was that some of the mines that the Accentor-class minesweeper was trying to detect were detonated by a copper wire coming out of the top of the mine that is used to detect the magnetic field that is produced by the metal hulls of most ships; when the wire senses a magnetic field, it detonates the mine.  Minesweepers use wooden hulls because wood is a non-magnetic material, unlike steel, and would not set off this type of mine.  The second is that wooden hulls were lighter than metal hulls.  This caused them to float higher in the water, which made them displace less water and have a smaller pressure wave, so pressure mines would not be set off by the movement of the ship.  Lastly, due to the ship floating higher in the water, contact mines were not effective because they were often around 20 feet below the surface of the water, and the draft of this class of ship was between 8 feet 11 inches and 10 feet 8 inches.  Typically, the Accentor-class minesweepers were armed with a pair of .50 caliber machine guns for protection.  Rather than creating new minesweeping vessels, forty-five wooden-hulled fishing boats were converted into Accentor-class minesweepers.  This saved the Navy both time and money.  Since these converted fishing boats were not all the same, their specifications do vary a bit.  The converted fishing boats had a displacement from 165 to 270 tons of water.  They had speeds from 8.5 up to 14 knots and crews from as small as 15 up to 50.\n\nColomac Mine\nThe Colomac Mine was a privately owned and operated open pit gold mine located 220 km northwest of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories in Canada .  The Colomac mine operated between 1990–1992, and 1994–1997.  It was operated by Neptune Resources Limited that had little success in making a profit during its operation.  In 1994, the mine had reopened under Royal Oak Mines Inc.  Both Neptune Resources and Royal Oak Mines where both owned and operated by Peggy Witte.  Due to low gold prices and high cost of mining, Royal Oak Mines was forced into bankruptcy.  The Federal Government of Canada became owners of the mine, along with the related environmental issues.  A major cleanup effort is under way to prevent the mine from polluting the environment, but this might be too late at this stage.  This mine is now owned and controlled by the Indigenous and Northern Affairs department of the Federal government, while Public Works and Government services is the current contracting authority.\n\n"}
{"context": "Treaty of Berwick (1639)\nThe Treaty of Berwick (also known as the Peace of Berwick or the Pacification of Berwick) was signed on 18 June 1639 between England and Scotland.  Archibald Johnston was involved in the negotiations before King Charles was forced to sign the treaty.  The agreement, overall, officially ended the First Bishops' War even though both sides saw it only as a temporary truce.  After the treaty was signed, King Charles immediately began to gather the resources he needed in order to strengthen his armies.  At the beginning of the Second Bishops' War, the agreement was broken.  After a disastrous skirmish at Kelso between the English advance guard and the Scottish Covenanter Army, the Earl of Holland fled back to the king’s headquarters at Berwick-upon-Tweed.  The Earl of Antrim failed to establish negotiations in order to bring the Irish army over.  This, along with the unsuccessful English naval campaign at Hamilton, meant that Charles was forced to sign a truce.  He conceded to the Scots the right to a free church assembly and a free parliament.  These rights were asserted (with the right to keep the existing legal structure instead of a separate parliament) along with the extension to Scotland of The Bill of Rights (which set out the conditions and powers of a monarch) in the Treaty of Union, 1707, which united England and Wales with Scotland.\n\nValdemar II of Denmark\nValdemar II (9 May 1170 or 28 June 1170 – 28 March 1241), called Valdemar the Victorious or Valdemar the Conqueror (\"Valdemar Sejr\"), was the King of Denmark from 1202 until his death in 1241.  The nickname \"Sejr\" is a later invention and was not used during the King's own lifetime.  \"Sejr\" means \"victory\" in Danish.\n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Reval\nThe Bishopric of Reval was created in Duchy of Estonia by Valdemar II of Denmark in 1240.  Contradictory to canon law Valdemar II reserved the right to appoint the bishops of Reval to himself and his successor kings of Denmark.  The decision to simply nominate the see of Reval was unique in the whole Catholic Church at the time and was disputed by bishops and the Pope.  During the era, the election of bishops was never established in Reval and the royal rights to the bishopric and to nominate the bishops was even included in the treaty when the territories of the Duchy of Estonia were sold to Teutonic Order in 1346.\n\nConcordat of Worms\nThe Concordat of Worms (Latin: \"Concordatum Wormatiense\" ), sometimes called the Pactum Calixtinum by papal historians, was an agreement between Pope Calixtus II and Holy Roman Emperor Henry V on September 23, 1122, near the city of Worms.  It brought to an end the first phase of the power struggle between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperors and has been interpreted as containing within itself the germ of nation-based sovereignty that would one day be confirmed in the Treaty of Westphalia (1648).  In part this was an unforeseen result of strategic maneuvering between the Church and the European sovereigns over political control within their domains.  The King was recognised as having the right to invest bishops with secular authority (\"by the lance\") in the territories they governed, but not with sacred authority (\"by ring and staff\").  The result was that bishops owed allegiance in worldly matters both to the pope and to the king, for they were obliged to affirm the right of the sovereign to call upon them for military support, under his oath of fealty.  Previous Holy Roman Emperors had thought it their right, granted by God, to name Church officials within their territories (such as bishops) and to confirm the Papal election (and, at times of extraordinary urgency, actually name popes).  In fact, the Emperors had been heavily relying on bishops for their secular administration, as they were not hereditary or quasi-hereditary nobility with family interests.  A more immediate result of the Investiture struggle identified a proprietary right that adhered to sovereign territory, recognising the right of kings to income from the territory of a vacant diocese and a basis for justifiable taxation.  These rights lay outside feudalism, which defined authority in a hierarchy of personal relations, with only a loose relation to territory.  The pope emerged as a figure above and out of the direct control of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nWoolland\nWoolland is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England, situated in the Blackmore Vale under Bulbarrow Hill 7 mi west of Blandford Forum.  In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 50.  The village had a population of 76 in 2001.  The village is first mentioned in Cartularium saxonicum from the year 939 \"Wonlond\", the Domesday Book from the year 1086 \"Winlande\" and the Pipe Rolls from the year 1170 \"Wunlanda\".  The name is interpreted as Old English wynn-land \"meadow land\" or \"pasture land\".\n\nHove Church\nHove Church (Norwegian: \"Hove kyrkje\" ) is a historic parish church in Vik Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.  It is located in the village of Vikøyri on the Arnafjord, an arm of Sognefjord.  The old parish of Hove (together with Hopperstad) was abolished in 1875, and replaced by the new, united, Vik parish.  The church and parish of Vik is a part of Indre Sogn deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.  The stone church was built around the year 1170.  Historians believe it was built for a wealthy man who belonged to the very upper echelon within the Norwegian aristocracy.  They say he had built this as a private chapel with seating for only about 35 people.\n\nYi Go\nYi Go (? –1171) was a military ruler in Korea.  He, with many other military colonels, overthrew King Uijong in the year 1170.  When he proceeded to plan a revolt, he was murdered by Yi Ui-bang.\n\nTurpin of Brechin\nTurpin was a 12th-century bishop of Brechin.  Turpin has come to the court of king William the Lion as early as 1170, when his name begins to appear in the charters of king William.  He was elected to the see of Brechin in 1178, probably with the backing of king William, and consecrated in 1180.  He is the first of the non-Gaelic bishops of Brechin.  His death date is not known, but it was certainly before the year 1198.  He was succeeded by another Norman called Radulphus.\n\n417\nYear 417 (CDXVII) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Honorius and Constantius (or, less frequently, year 1170 \"Ab urbe condita\").  The denomination 417 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\nKingdom of Livonia\nThe Kingdom of Livonia was a nominal state in what is now the territory of Estonia and Latvia.  The Russian Tsar Ivan IV declared the establishment of the kingdom during the Livonian War of 1558-1583, but it never functioned properly as a polity.  On June 10, 1570 the Danish Duke Magnus of Holstein arrived in Moscow, where he was crowned King of Livonia.  Magnus took the oath of allegiance to Ivan as his overlord and received from him the corresponding charter for the vassal kingdom of Livonia in what Ivan termed his patrimony.  The treaty between Magnus and Ivan IV was signed by an oprichnik and by a member of the \"zemskii\" administration, the d'iak Vasiliy Shchelkalov.  The territories of the prospective new kingdom still had to be conquered, but nevertheless Põltsamaa Castle was proclaimed the future official residence of the king.  The new king Magnus of Livonia departed from Moscow with 20,000 Russian soldiers for the conquest of Swedish-controlled Reval.  Ivan's hope for the support of King Frederick II of Denmark, the older brother of Magnus, failed.  By the end of March 1571 Magnus gave up the struggle for Reval and abandoned the siege.\n\n"}
{"context": "Arsinoe IV of Egypt\nArsinoë IV (Greek: \"Ἀρσινόη\" , between 68 and 59 BC – 41 BC) was the fourth of six children and the youngest daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes, and queen and co-ruler of Egypt with Ptolemy XIII from 48 BC – 47 BC, making her one of the last members of the Ptolemaic dynasty of ancient Egypt.  Arsinoë IV was the half-sister of Cleopatra VII and also a sibling of Ptolemy XIII.\n\nGabiniani\nThe Gabiniani (in English Gabinians) were 2,000 Roman legionaries and 500 Roman auxiliary cavalry left in Egypt by the general Aulus Gabinius after his military restoration of Ptolemy XII on the Egyptian throne in 55 BC.  The soldiers were left to protect the king, but they soon adopted the manners of their new country and became completely alienated from the Roman Republic.  After the death of Ptolemy XII in 51 BC they helped his son Ptolemy XIII in the power struggle against his sister Cleopatra VII and even involved Julius Caesar, the powerful supporter of Cleopatra, in the Alexandrinian war (48-47 BC) in violent battles.\n\nSvegliatevi nel core\n\"Svegliatevi nel core\" is an aria taken from Act I, Scene IV of the Italian language opera seria, \"Giulio Cesare\", by George Frideric Handel.  The aria is written for the role of “Sesto”, a soprano in trouser role, including during the premiere, who sings it to assure his mother that he will avenge the death of his father, Pompey, who was assassinated by the Egyptians, instructed by Tolomeo (Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator) to demonstrate the Egyptians' loyalty to Julius Caesar.  The words were written by Nicola Francesco Haym.\n\nAëtus son of Aëtus\nAëtus son of Aëtus (in Greek Ἀετὸς τοῦ Ἀετοῦ, in ancient Egyptian (transliterated from demotic) \"Ꜣyꜣtws (sꜣ) Ꜣyꜣtws\") was a priest in the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great under the reign of Ptolemy V.  According to the inscription on the Rosetta Stone Aëtus in 196 BC held the annual priesthood \"of Alexander and the Saviour Gods and the Sibling Gods and the Beneficent Gods and the Sibling-loving Gods and the Father-loving God\", that is, of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy I Soter and his wife Berenice I Soter, Ptolemy II and his wife and sister Arsinoe II, Ptolemy III Euergetes and his wife Berenice II Euergetis, Ptolemy IV Philadelphus and his wife and sister Arsinoe III Philadelpha, and finally of the young king Ptolemy V Philopator who was still on the throne.

Following the death of his older brother Ptolemy XIII of Egypt on January 13, 47 BC, he was proclaimed Pharaoh and co-ruler by their older sister and remaining Pharaoh, Cleopatra VII of Egypt.  He and Cleopatra were married, but Cleopatra continued to act as lover of Roman dictator Julius Caesar.  Ptolemy is considered to have reigned in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority to herself.  On March 15, 44 BC Caesar was murdered in Rome by a group of conspirators whose most notable members were Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.  Ptolemy soon followed him in death.  An inscription mentioning him as alive was dated at July 26, 44 BC.  It has been assumed but remains uncertain that Cleopatra poisoned her co-ruler, with aconite, to replace him with his nephew Ptolemy XV Caesarion, her son by Caesar who was proclaimed co-ruler on September 2, 44 BC and whom his mother intended to support as successor of his father.\n\n"}

{"context": "Little Joe 1A\nLittle Joe 1A (LJ-1A) was an unmanned rocket launched as part of NASA's Mercury program on November 4, 1959.  This flight, a repeat of the Little Joe 1 (LJ-1) launch, was to test a launch abort under high aerodynamic load conditions.  After lift-off, the pressure sensing system was to indicate when the correct abort dynamic pressure was reached.  This should have happened about thirty seconds after launch.  A signal was sent to the explosive bolts to separate the spacecraft from the launch vehicle.  Up to this point, everything was going as planned.  The impulse was also intended to ignite the escape motor.  The motor was ignited, but it took a number of seconds to build up thrust, and thus the abort maneuver was not accomplished at the desired dynamic pressure.  Because of this, a repeat of the test was planned.  Other events from launch through recovery occurred without incident.  An altitude of 9 statute miles (14.5 km) and a range of 11.5 statute miles (18.5 km) were obtained, and a speed of 2,021.6 miles per hour (3,254 km/h) was reached.  Flight time 8 minutes 11 seconds.

Mr. Lamina is the youngest Mayor in Sierra Leone's history, and at the time of his inauguration was the youngest Mayor in West Africa.  Mayor Lamina is adored and loved by the people of Kono for his humility and his progressive policies.  He has always been focused on building his city lot by lot, block by block.  He's known for bringing city government closer to the people, by holding regular town-hall meetings, press conferences and quarterly mobile council meetings in the various neighborhoods of the city (first of it kind in the country), which earned him the nickname \"the mayor of neighborhoods.\"  Soon after taking office, Mayor Lamina called for more transparent, participatory, and collaborative government.  Mayor Lamina, also known as Mr. Incorruptible, introduced strict anti-corruption programs and open-government policies to the dismay of the district political elites, paramount chiefs, and party leaders in the national capital Freetown, who have been the beneficiaries of decades long culture of corruption that has kept the district on the bottom in terms of development.  The diamond rich Kono District (the bread basket of the nation) has been the most neglected district in the country and its capital Koidu City was the most under-develop city in the country.  The city was completely burnt down during the civil war in the nineteen-nineties.  But under Mayor Lamina's leadership, Koidu City has seen a lot of improvements.  His administration has installed hundreds of new solar lights in the city, paved major streets, rehabilitated and reconstructed schools, provided new furniture to primary and secondary schools, rehabilitated the Koidu Government Hospital and procured essential drugs for the hospital, established bi-lateral ties with cities around the world, and implemented policies targeting Diasporas as agents for development.\n\nPan Yuliang\nPan Yuliang (, 14 June 1895 – 1977), born in Yangzhou as Chen Xiuqing, and was renamed Zhang Yuliang (張玉良) when adopted by her maternal uncle after the early passing of her parents.

Because her modernist works caused controversy and drew severe criticism in China during the 1930s, Pan returned to Paris in 1937 to live and work for the next 40 years.  She taught at the \"École des Beaux Arts\", won several awards for her work, had exhibits internationally in Europe, the United States and Japan, and was collected by major institutions.  In 1985 after her death, much of her work was transported to China, collected by the National Art Museum in the capital of Beijing, and a few are collected by the Anhui Museum in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province.  Her life as an artist has been portrayed in novels and film in China and the United States.  Her art evolved within the flux of transformations where conflicting dichotomies of East and West, tradition and modernity, male chauvinism and emerging feminism co-existed.

{"context": "League of the Three Emperors\nThe Three Caesars' Alliance or League of the Three Emperors (German: \"Dreikaiserabkommen\" , Russian: Союз трёх императоров ) was an alliance between the German Empire, the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary, from 1873 to 1887.  Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took full charge of German foreign policy from 1870 to his dismissal in 1890.  His goal was a peaceful Europe, based on the balance of power.  Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia would crush Germany.  If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands.  The solution was to ally with two of the three.  In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance of the Kaiser of Germany, the Tsar of Russia, and the Kaiser of Austria-Hungary.  Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control.  It aimed at neutralizing the rivalry between Germany’s two neighbors by an agreement over their respective spheres of influence in the Balkans and at isolating Germany’s enemy, France.  The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck's solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas.\n\nAustro–Serbian Alliance of 1881\nThe Austro–Serbian Alliance of 1881 was a secret political alliance signed on 28 June 1881 between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Principality of Serbia.  It resulted in the effective association of Serbia with Austria-Hungary and the coming Triple Alliance.  The Balkans had been divided into spheres of influence, where Austria took the western part (including Serbia) and Russia took the eastern part (including Bulgaria).  The treaty came after the railway convention of 6 April 1881 for the construction of the Belgrade–Niš section of the Vienna–Constantinople railway, and the trade treaty of 6 May 1881 which made Austria-Hungary virtually the sole market for agricultural products from Serbia and thereby dominant.\n\nDual Alliance (1879)\nThe Dual Alliance was a defensive alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary, which was created by treaty on 7 October 1879 as part of Bismarck's system of alliances to prevent or limit war.  The two powers promised each other support in case of attack by Russia.  Also, each state promised benevolent neutrality to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be France, even more so after the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894).  Germany’s Otto von Bismarck saw the alliance as a way to prevent the isolation of Germany and to preserve peace, as Russia would not wage war against both empires.\n\nReinsurance Treaty\nThe Reinsurance Treaty, (June 18, 1887), a secret agreement between Germany and Russia arranged by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck after the German-Austrian-Russian \"Dreikaiserbund\" or League of the Three Emperors, collapsed in 1887, because of competition between Austria-Hungary (Franz Joseph I) and Russia (Alexander III) for spheres of influence in the Balkans.  The treaty provided that each party would remain neutral if the other became involved in a war with a third great power, though this would not apply if Germany attacked France or if Russia attacked Austria.  Bismarck showed the Russian ambassador the text of the German-Austrian alliance of 1879 to drive home the last point.  Germany paid for Russian friendship by agreeing to the Russian sphere of influence in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (now part of southern Bulgaria) and by agreeing to support Russian action to keep the Black Sea as its own preserve.  When the treaty was not renewed in 1890, a Franco-Russian alliance rapidly began to take shape.\n\nHamlet Q1\nQ1 of \"Hamlet\", or the \"First Quarto\" as it is also called, is a short early text of the Shakespearean play.  The intended publication of the play is entered in the Stationers' Register in 1602 by James Roberts, but Q1 was not published until summer or autumn 1603.  It was published by the booksellers Nicholas Ling and John Trundell, and printed by Valentine Simmes.  Roberts later printed the \"Second Quarto\" (Q2).\n\nReichstadt Agreement\nThe Reichstadt agreement was an agreement made between Austria-Hungary and Russia in July 1876, who were at that time in an alliance with each other and Germany in the League of the Three Emperors, or \"Dreikaiserbund\".  Present were the Russian and Austro-Hungarian emperors together with their foreign ministers, Prince Gorchakov of Russia and Count Andrassy of Austria-Hungary.  The closed meeting took place on July 8 in the Bohemian city of Reichstadt (now Zákupy).  They agreed on a common approach to the solution of the Eastern question, due to the unrest in the Ottoman Empire and the interests of the two major powers in the Balkans.  They discussed the likely Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, its possible outcomes and what should happen under each scenario.\n\nAnti-Coup Alliance\nThe Anti-Coup Alliance (also known as the National Alliance Supporting Legitimacy) is a coalition in Egypt formed to defeat the ouster of former president Mohamed Morsi.  The coalition is made up of approximately 40 Islamist parties and groups.  The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call \"corrupt\" from the Mubarak regime.  Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013.  The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president.  The group has reached out to what it called \"fellow revolutionaries\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation.  Members of the Building and Development Party, the political arm of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, wanted to meet with Yasser Al Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call as well as Emad Abdel Ghaffour, who is the head of the Homeland Party.  Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the Shura Council that was dissolved.  Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions.  The alliance has said it will boycott the 2014 constitutional referendum.  Various groups and parties within the alliance including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the Nour Party for its support of the draft constitution.  The Islamic Party has not participated in meetings with the group because of what Mohamed Abu Samra (the secretary-general of the party) called the \"brotherhood's radical thought\".  The Salafist Front issued a statement on 30 April 2014 that called on the alliance to temporarily stop its actions in order to avoid more violence; the alliance did not suspend its activities in response.  Egyptian Prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree on 16 October 2014 banning the alliance.  Another decree was issued on 30 October 2014 which dissolved the alliance.  A court postponed the appeal of the dissolution of the alliance until 13 November 2014.\n\nTriple Alliance (1882)\nThe Triple Alliance, also known as the Triplice, was a secret agreement between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed on 20 May 1882 and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during the Diplomatic history of World War I.  Germany and Austria-Hungary had been closely allied since 1879.  Italy sought support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French.  Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power.  The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation.  In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France.

It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente.  The Powers' origin was the alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879.  The Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria did not join until after World War I had begun, although the Ottoman Empire retained close relations with both Germany and Austria-Hungary since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nHoly Alliance\nThe Holy Alliance (German: \"Heilige Allianz\" ; Russian: Священный союз , \"Svyashchennyy soyuz\"; also called the Grand Alliance) was a coalition created by the monarchist great powers of Russia, Austria and Prussia.  It was created after the ultimate defeat of Napoleon at the behest of Tsar Alexander I of Russia and signed in Paris on 26 September 1815.  The intention of the alliance was to restrain liberalism and secularism in Europe in the wake of the devastating French Revolutionary Wars, and the alliance nominally succeeded in this until the Crimean War (1853–1856).  Otto von Bismarck managed to reunite the Holy Alliance after the unification of Germany but the alliance again faltered by the 1880s over Austrian and Russian conflicts of interest with regard to the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n"}

{"context": "Grand Slam (tennis)\nThe Grand Slam tournaments, also called majors, are the four most important annual tennis events.  They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of \"best of\" sets for men.  The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, the French Open in May and June, Wimbledon in July, and the US Open in August and September.  Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks.  The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass.  Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905.  However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924–25, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments.  Skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money—was not unusual before 1982, which was the start of the norm of counting Grand Slam titles.\n\n2006 Qatar Ladies Open – Doubles\nAlicia Molik and Francesca Schiavone were the defending champions, but Molik did not compete this year.

Building sci-fi forts from cardboard boxes and bricks, drawing control panels on the walls, etc.  I liked creating the forts more than I did playing in them.  There was something wonderful about making something tangible, something others could see, participate in.  Then I moved to drawing my own comic books.  I loved comic books–Marvel, DC.  I collected them and had a couple of thousand of them.  I drew one sci-fi comic book (a rip-off of Space 1999 and BattleStar Galactica) that numbered up to like 24 or 25.  I was serious about it.  Then I started writing barbarian stories.  I loved Tarzan and Conan the Barbarian and so wrote a lot of bad imitations of those.\"  Interestingly, Franklin was a marginal student; for example, in high school, he characterized himself as a \"C student.

A nonfiction essay is a short, nonfiction narrative work of prose literature that is analytic, speculative, or interpretive in nature, dealing with or offering opinions or conjectures upon facts and reality, and written from the author’s point of view.  On the Pleasure of Hating is seen as an essay because it is written to express Hazlitt’s point of view on the lack of sympathy that people have.  For example, on page 189, Hazlitt proceeds to explain that,“We learn to curb our will and keep our overt actions within the bounds of humanity, long before we can subdue our sentiments and imaginations to the same mild tone.” Hazlitt gives this example as he is about to kill a spider.  Hazlitt comes to the realization that the spider has done nothing to harm him.  Why should he kill the innocent spider if the spider just means to be crawling from one place to another?  Hazlitt tries to make the reader comprehend that society is the one that has placed pressure on hating things just to avoid us from hating ourselves.\n\nWest Shore, Staten Island\nWest Shore refers to the section of the New York City borough of Staten Island that borders the Arthur Kill, between the Staten Island Expressway and the Fresh Kills.

{"context": "Pastorale (Stravinsky)\nPastorale (Russian: Пастораль ) is a song without words written by Igor Stravinsky in 1907.  Stravinsky composed the piece at his family's estate in Ustilug, Ukraine, while under the supervision of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and dedicated it to Rimsky-Korsakov's daughter Nadia.\n\nChristmas Eve (opera)\nChristmas Eve (Russian: Ночь перед Рождеством , \"Noch' pered Rozhdestvom\"), is an opera in four acts with music and libretto by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  Composed between 1894 and 1895, Rimsky-Korsakov based his opera on a short story, \"Christmas Eve\", from Nikolai Gogol's \"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\".  The story had been used as the basis for an opera at least three times previously, including for Tchaikovsky's \"Vakula the Smith\" (1874).  Oliver Knussen writes that \"Rimsky is only interested in recreating the atmosphere of the folk-tale, fleshing it out for his stage pageant in a comparable way to Humperdinck in \"Hansel\".\n\nScheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)\nScheherazade, also commonly Sheherazade (Russian: Шехераза́да , \"Shekherazáda\"; ] ), Op.  35, is a symphonic suite composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1888 and based on \"One Thousand and One Nights\", also known as \"The Arabian Nights\".  This orchestral work combines two features typical of Russian music and of Rimsky-Korsakov in particular: dazzling, colorful orchestration and an interest in the East, which figured greatly in the history of Imperial Russia, as well as orientalism in general.  The name \"Scheherazade\" refers to the main character \"Shahrazad\" of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\".  It is considered Rimsky-Korsakov's most popular work.\n\nSadko (musical tableau)\nSadko, Op.  5, is a \"musical tableau\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, written in 1867 and revised in 1869 and 1892.  It is sometimes called the first symphonic poem written in Russia.  It was first performed in 1867 at a concert of the Russian Musical Society (RMS), conducted by Mily Balakirev.  Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote an opera of the same name which quotes freely from the earlier work.  From the tone poem the composer quoted its most memorable passages in the opera, including the opening theme of the swelling sea, and other themes as leitmotives - he himself set out to \"utilize for this opera the material of my symphonic poem, and, in any event, to make use of its motives as leading motives for the opera\".\n\nElegia (Madetoja)\nElegia (In English: Elegy; occasionally with the Finnish subtitle \"Suru \", or \"Sadness\"), Op.  4/1, is a composition for string orchestra by the Finnish composer Leevi Madetoja, who wrote the piece in 1909 during his student years.  On 10 January 1910, Robert Kajanus, chief conductor of the Helsinki Orchestral Society, premiered the \"Elegia\" to great acclaim, with the piece described as the \"first master work\" of a budding \"natural orchestral composer\".  Madetoja subsequently designated the \"Elegia\" as the first number in his four-movement \"Sinfoninen sarja\" (\"Symphonic Suite\"), Op. 4, which the Helsinki Orchestral Society performed in its entirety under the composer's baton on 26 September 1910.  The suite's three other numbers are virtually unknown, and the \"Elegia\" typically is performed as a stand-alone concert piece.  Stylistically reminiscent of Tchaikovsky, it is, to date, Madetoja's most recorded and well-known orchestral composition, as well as the most enduringly popular of his many miniatures.\n\nRussian Symphony Concerts\nThe idea for the Russian Symphony Concerts was Rimsky-Korsakov's.  He had become acquainted with Belyayev at the weekly \"quartet Fridays\" (\"Les Vendredis\") held at Belayev's home.  Belayev had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov, who had been one of Rimsky-Korsakov's composition students.  In 1884, Belayev rented out a hall and hired an orchestra to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed.  Glazunov was to conduct part of this concert.  Seeing he was not ready to do this, Rimsky-Korsakov volunteered to take his place.  This \"rehearsal,\" as Rimsky-Korsakov called it, went well and pleased both Belayev and the invited audience.  Buoyed by the success of the rehearsal, Belayev decided the following season to give a public concert of works by Glazunov and other composers.  Rimsky-Korsakov's piano concerto was played, along with Glazunov's symphonic poem \"Stenka Razin\".\n\nMake Me Love You\nMake Me Love You is the debut album by Australian instrumental band, PVT, released under their earlier name, Pivot.  It was released on 8 August 2005 through Sensory Projects, distributed by Inertia Distribution.  It received strong radio support (particularly the track \"Montecore\") and a nomination for the J Award, or Australian Album of the Year, by national radio station, Triple J.  The album was produced by the group's Richard Pike, mixed by Richard Belkner and mastered by William Bowden.  One notable sample from the album is the use of the violin from Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's 1888 piece \"Scheherazade\" on the second track of the album, \"Artificial Horizon\".  In October 2015 PVT re-issued \"Make Me Love You\" in a vinyl format with a bonus CD, \"You Make Me Love - B-Sides & Demos 2003-2005\", of material from the original recording sessions.  They followed with two Australian shows to promote this release in November.\n\nCapriccio Espagnol\nCapriccio espagnol, Op.  34, is the common Western title for a five movement orchestral suite, based on Spanish folk melodies, composed by the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1887.  Rimsky-Korsakov originally intended to write the work for a solo violin with orchestra, but later decided that a purely orchestral work would do better justice to the lively melodies.  The Russian title is Каприччио на испанские темы (literally, Capriccio on Spanish Themes).\n\nAntar (Rimsky-Korsakov)\nAntar is a composition for symphony orchestra in four movements by the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  He wrote the piece in 1868 but revised it in 1875 and 1891.  He initially called the work his Second Symphony.  He later reconsidered and called it a symphonic suite.  It was first performed in 1869 at a concert of the Russian Musical Society.\n\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\nNikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov (18 March [O.S. 6 March] 1844 21 June [O.S. 8 June] 1908 ) was a Russian composer, and a member of the group of composers known as The Five.  He was a master of orchestration.  His best-known orchestral compositions—\"Capriccio Espagnol\", the \"Russian Easter Festival Overture\", and the symphonic suite \"Scheherazade\"—are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas.  \"Scheherazade\" is an example of his frequent use of fairy tale and folk subjects.\n\n"}

{"context": "Asset poverty\nAsset poverty is an economic and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty.  It can be defined as a household’s inability to access wealth resources that are sufficient to provide for basic needs for a period of three months.  Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.  Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).  Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets.  Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above.  Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations.  Liquid assets are resources that are readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings.  There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible.  Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate.  Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.\n\nSenegal\nSenegal ( ; French: \"Sénégal\" ), officially the Republic of Senegal (French: \"République du Sénégal\" ] ), is a country in West Africa.

Senegal also shares a maritime border with Cape Verde.  Senegal's economic and political capital is Dakar.  It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia, and owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north.  The name \"Senegal\" comes from the Wolof \"Sunuu Gaal\", which means \"Our Boat\".  Senegal covers a land area of almost 197000 km2 and has an estimated population of about /1e6 round 0 million.  The climate is Sahelian, but there is a rainy season.\n\nHizb-i-Wahdat\nHizb-e Wahdat-e Islami Afghanistan (Persian: حزب وحدت اسلامی افغانستان‎ ‎ ; \"the Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan\"), shortened to Hizb-e Wahdat (حزب وحدت ), was founded in 1989.  Like most contemporary major political parties in Afghanistan, Hizb-e Wahdat is rooted in the turbulent period of the anti-Soviet resistance movements in Afghanistan in the 1980s.  It was formed to bring together nine separate and mostly inimical military and ideological groups into a single entity.  During the period of the Afghan civil war in the early 1990s, it emerged as one of the major actors in Kabul and some other parts of the country.  Political Islamism was the ideology of most of its key leaders but the party gradually tilted towards its Hazara ethnic support base and became the key vehicle of the community’s political demands and aspirations.  Its ideological background and ethnic support base has continuously shaped its character and political agenda.  Through the anti-Soviet jihad and the civil war, Hizb-e Wahdat accumulated significant political capital among Afghanistan’s Hazaras.\n\nList of companies of Senegal\nSenegal is a country in West Africa.

This form of capital is accumulated by maintaining consistent policy positions and ideological views.  Representative capital refers to a politician’s influence in policy-setting.  This form of capital is accumulated through experience, seniority, and serving in leadership positions.  Thus, political capital—reputational and representative—is the product of relationships between opinion (public impressions), policy (legislative rewards/penalties), and political judgement (prudent decision-making).\n\nNdé\nNDE is one of the 58 divisions found in Cameroon.

{"context": "Oviraptor\nOviraptor is a genus of small Mongolian theropod dinosaurs, first discovered by technician George Olsen in an expedition led by Roy Chapman Andrews, and first described by Henry Fairfield Osborn, in 1924.  Its name is Latin for 'egg taker' or \"egg seizer\", referring to the fact that the first fossil specimen was discovered atop a pile of what were thought to be \"Protoceratops\" eggs, and the specific name \"philoceratops\" means \"lover of ceratopsians\", also given as a result of this find.  In his 1924 paper, Osborn explained that the name was given due to the close proximity of the skull of \"Oviraptor\" to the nest (it was separated from the eggs by only 4 in of sand).  However, Osborn also suggested that the name \"Oviraptor\" \"may entirely mislead us as to its feeding habits and belie its character\".  In the 1990s, the discovery of nesting oviraptorids like \"Citipati\" proved that Osborn was correct in his caution regarding the name.  These finds showed that the eggs in question probably belonged to \"Oviraptor\" itself, and that the specimen was actually brooding its eggs, when it died at the nest.\n\nPersonnel of the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition\nThe Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, 1921–22, was the last Antarctic expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton.

The expedition was commanded by Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry, under orders from American President Millard Fillmore.  Perry’s primary goal was to force an end to Japan’s 220-year-old policy of isolation and to open Japanese ports to American trade, through the use of gunboat diplomacy if necessary.  The Perry Expedition led directly to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the western \"Great Powers\", and eventually to the collapse of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate.\n\nHal Lister\nHal Lister (1 May 192124 February 2010) was a British geographer and Arctic explorer.

Beyond the \"noh\" source dramatic material, Britten incorporated elements of \"noh\" treatment of theatrical time into this composition.  \"Curlew River\" marked a departure in style for the remainder of the composer's creative life, paving the way for such works as \"Owen Wingrave\", \"Death in Venice\", and the Third String Quartet.\n\nNeil Mackie\nNeil Mackie (born 1946) is a Scottish tenor.

The first major composition written for the instruments was the Sonata for flute, viola and harp (1915) by Claude Debussy; Debussy had set out to compose a set of chamber works for \"diverse ensembles,\" as distinguished from more common groupings like string quartet or piano trio.  Though other composers have written chamber works that feature harp, this set of instruments has gained a repertoire, which places it among other established genres of the twentieth century such as the \"Pierrot ensemble\" (flute, clarinet, piano, violin and cello, with frequently added percussion or voice).\n\nClaude Debussy\nAchille-Claude Debussy (] , 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918), known since the 1890s as Claude-Achille Debussy or Claude Debussy, was a French composer.

It was composed between October 1889 and April 1890 but it received its first public performance only in 1919, a year after Debussy's death, in London by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Alfred Cortot as soloist.  It is Debussy's only composition for piano and orchestra and, even though it is written in a three movement form, it was not composed as a Piano Concerto.  Today it is one of Debussy's least frequently performed works. 　This work is dedicated to the pianist René Chansarel, who had been scheduled to play the solo part for the cancelled premiere in 1890.\n\n"}

The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from \"Wayne's Power Minute\"), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey).

Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties.  The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the \"bag\" has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  It may only contain articles intended for official use.

These missile attack warnings were correctly identified as a false alarm by Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces.  This decision is seen as having prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack based on erroneous data on the United States and its NATO allies, which would have probably resulted in immediate escalation of the cold-war stalemate to a full-scale nuclear war.  Investigation of the satellite warning system later confirmed that the system had malfunctioned.\n\nKorean Air Lines Flight 902\nOn 20 April 1978, Soviet air defense shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 902 (KAL 902) near Murmansk, Soviet Union, after the civilian aircraft violated Soviet airspace and failed to respond to Soviet ground control and interceptors.  Soviet Air Defence Forces initially identified it as part of the US air reconnaissance force, which carried out thousands of flights along Soviet borders annually at the time.  Captain Alexander Bosov, pilot of the Sukhoi Su-15 that brought down Flight 902, saw Asian logogram characters on the tail of the Korean aircraft, and reported this to the ground control.  Despite this, Vladimir Tsarkov, commander of the 21st Soviet Air Defence Corps, ordered Bosov to take down the plane, as the plane failed to respond to repeated orders to land, and was approaching the Soviet border with Finland.  The Su-15 opened fire, forcing the plane to descend, and killing two of the 109 passengers and crew members aboard Flight 902.

The Seahawks won its first Division title in the AFC West for the first time in franchise history.  Despite only winning the division with a 9-7 record, and only finishing with a +10 point differential, the Seahawks were still one of the most successful teams in the NFL in 1988.  The team never went under .500 during the season, and clinched the AFC West in week 17 with a 43-37 shootout win over the Los Angeles Raiders with some help from their win the previous week against the Broncos, who finished second in the AFC West.

Levon Helm is the narrator in the introduction and elsewhere in the film, as well as having a co-starring role as Air Force test pilot Jack Ridley.\n\nThe Right Stuff (book)\nThe Right Stuff is a 1979 book by Tom Wolfe about the pilots engaged in U.S. postwar research with experimental rocket-powered, high-speed aircraft as well as documenting the stories of the first Project Mercury astronauts selected for the NASA space program.  \"The Right Stuff\" is based on extensive research by Wolfe, who interviewed test pilots, the astronauts and their wives, among others.  The story contrasts the \"Mercury Seven\" and their families with test pilots such as Chuck Yeager, who was considered by many contemporaries as the best of them all, but who was never selected as an astronaut.\n\nJohn Glenn\nJohn Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921 – December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senator from Ohio.

The term was coined in 1995 by Hollywood producer James Cross as a comparison to the Mercury Seven name given to the selected male astronauts; however, the Mercury 13 were not part of NASA's astronaut program, never flew in space and never met as a group.\n\nRevolutionary Communist Party (Turkey)\nRevolutionary Communist Party (in Turkish: \"Devrimci Komünist Partisi\") was a clandestine communist party in Turkey.

{"context": "Josce de Dinan\nJosce de Dinan (died 1166) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who lived during and after the civil war between King Stephen of England and his cousin Matilda over the throne of England.  He was a landholder in the Welsh Marches when he was married by Stephen to the widow of Pain fitzJohn, a union that gave Josce control of Ludlow Castle.  Control of the castle was contested by other noblemen, and the resulting warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval romance known as \"Fouke le Fitz Waryn\", which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime.  Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted lands in compensation by Matilda and her son, King Henry II of England, who succeeded Stephen in 1154.\n\nHenry de Longchamp\nHenry de Longchamp or Henry de Longo Campo (c1150–1212) was an Anglo-Norman administrator.\n\nTreaty of Tours\nThe Treaty of Tours was an agreement between Henry VI of England and the Charles VII of France, signed on 22 May 1444.  The terms stipulated the marriage of Charles VII's fifteen-year-old niece, Margaret of Anjou, to Henry VI and the agreement of a 21-month truce between the Kingdoms of England and France.  In exchange for the marriage, Charles wanted the area of Maine in northern France.  Henry VI married Margaret a year later, in April 1445, when Henry VI was 23 years old.  He did not, however, give up Maine.  Charles threatened Henry VI and sent envoys to pressure him; even Margaret tried to persuade Henry to give it up.  Henry eventually yielded in 1448 when Charles VII threatened English garrisons with a large army.  The Treaty was seen as a major failure for England as the bride secured for Henry VI was a poor match, being related to King Charles VII only distantly, and through marriage rather than by blood.  Her marriage came also without a dowry, when the amount that should have been given was 20,000 livres.  Margaret of Anjou was the daughter of the impoverished René of Anjou and in addition to being presented with Margaret without a dowry, Henry was also expected to pay for the wedding.  The Treaty of Tours exacerbated rifts between the court's Beaufort faction and the Dukes of Gloucester and York, and has been considered a potentially contributory factor to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses.\n\nEngland in the High Middle Ages\nEngland in the High Middle Ages includes the history of England between the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the death of King John, considered by some to be the last of the Angevin kings of England, in 1216.  A disputed succession and victory at the Battle of Hastings led to the conquest of England by William of Normandy in 1066.  This linked the crown of England with possessions in France and brought a new aristocracy to the country that dominated landholding, government and the church.  They brought with them the French language and maintained their rule through a system of castles and the introduction of a feudal system of landholding.  By the time of William's death in 1087, England formed the largest part of an Anglo-Norman empire, ruled by nobles with landholdings across England, Normandy and Wales.  William's sons disputed succession to his lands, with William II emerging as ruler of England and much of Normandy.  On his death in 1100 his younger brother claimed the throne as Henry I and defeated his brother Robert to reunite England and Normandy.  Henry was a ruthless yet effective king, but after the death of his only male heir in the White Ship tragedy, he persuaded his barons to recognise his daughter Matilda as heir.  When Henry died in 1135 her cousin Stephen of Blois had himself proclaimed king, leading to a civil war known as The Anarchy.  Eventually Stephen recognised Matilda's son Henry as his heir and when Stephen died in 1154, he succeeded as Henry II.\n\nEleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany\nEleanor Fair Maid of Brittany (c. 1184 – 10 August 1241), also known as Damsel of Brittany, Pearl of Brittany, or Beauty of Brittany, was the eldest daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, the fourth son of King Henry II of England, and Constance, Duchess of Brittany.  After the presumed death in 1203 of her imprisoned younger brother, Arthur, she was heiress to vast lands including England, Anjou, and Aquitaine as well as Brittany, realms where the Salic Law barring the accession of females did not apply.  Her uncle John, King of England was the fifth son of Henry II, and Eleanor inherited Arthur's claim to the throne as child of John's elder brother Geoffrey.  Thus she posed a potential threat to John, and following his death in 1216, equally to her cousin, Henry III of England.  She was imprisoned from 1202, and thus became the longest-imprisoned member of an English royal family.  As a prisoner she was also unable to press her claim to the Duchy of Brittany as her mother's heiress.\n\nReginald de Warenne\nReginald de Warenne (sometimes Rainald de Warenne; between 1121 and 1126 – 1179) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and royal official.  The third son of an earl, Reginald began his career as an administrator of his brother's estates and married the heiress to the feudal barony of Wormegay in Norfolk.  By the reign of King Henry II, Reginald was a royal justice and played a minor role in the Becket controversy in 1170.  He died in 1179 and left a son and heir together with several daughters.\n\nGeoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou\nGeoffrey V (24 August 1113 – 7 September 1151) — called the Handsome or the Fair (French: \"le Bel\" ) and Plantagenet — was the Count of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine by inheritance from 1129 and then Duke of Normandy by conquest from 1144.  By his marriage to the Empress Matilda, daughter and heiress of Henry I of England, Geoffrey had a son, Henry Curtmantle, who succeeded to the English throne as King Henry II (1154-1189) and was the first of the Plantagenet dynasty to rule England; the name \"Plantagenet\" was taken from Geoffrey's epithet.  His ancestral domain of Anjou gave rise to the name Angevin for three kings of England (Henry II his son and heir, and Henry's sons Richard and John), and what became known as the Angevin Empire in the 12th century.\n\nAngevin kings of England\nThe Angevins (\"from Anjou\") were an English royal house in the 12th and early 13th centuries; its monarchs were Henry II, Richard I and John.  In the 10 years from 1144, two successive counts of Anjou, Geoffrey and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the Angevin Empire.  As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding Norman and subsequent Plantagenet realms.  Geoffrey became Duke of Normandy in 1144 and died in 1151.  In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine.  Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, Empress Matilda, the daughter of King Henry I, to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of King Stephen.\n\nHugh de Cressy\nHugh de Cressy (died 1189) was an Anglo-Norman administrator and nobleman.  Little is known of his ancestry and he first served two brothers of King Henry II of England before becoming a royal official.  He was rewarded with a marriage to an heiress for his service to the king.  In England he often served as a royal justice and witnessed documents, which showed his closeness to the king.  On the continent, he recruited mercenaries for the royal army and was named constable of the castle of Rouen in the royal lands in France.  He died in 1189 after giving lands to various monasteries before his death.\n\nHenry II of England\nHenry II (5 March 1133 – 6 July 1189), also known as Henry Curtmantle (French: \"Court-manteau\" ), Henry FitzEmpress or Henry Plantagenet, ruled as Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Count of Nantes, King of England and Lord of Ireland; at various times, he also controlled Wales, Scotland and Brittany.  Henry was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England.  He became actively involved by the age of 14 in his mother's efforts to claim the throne of England, then occupied by Stephen of Blois, and was made Duke of Normandy at 17.  He inherited Anjou in 1151 and shortly afterwards married Eleanor of Aquitaine, whose marriage to Louis VII of France had recently been annulled.  Stephen agreed to a peace treaty after Henry's military expedition to England in 1153, and Henry inherited the kingdom on Stephen's death a year later.\n\n"}

{"context": "Chuck Berry\nCharles Edward Anderson Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music.  With songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive.  Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.\n\nSchool Days (song)\n\"School Days\" (also known as \"School Day (Ring!  Ring!  Goes the Bell)\") is a rock-and-roll song written and recorded by Chuck Berry and released by Chess Records as a single in March 1957 and on the LP \"After School Session\" two months later (see 1957 in music).

It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \"Ida Red,\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys.  Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance.  It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois.  It was Berry's first single and his first hit.  \"Maybellene\" is considered one of the pioneering rock songs: \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote, \"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\"  The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.  The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille.\n\nJohnny B. Goode\n\"Johnny B. Goode\" is a 1958 rock-and-roll song written and first recorded by Chuck Berry.

She was the first great recording star of gospel music and among the first gospel musicians to appeal to rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll audiences, later being referred to as \"the original soul sister\" and \"the godmother of rock and roll\".  She influenced early rock-and-roll musicians, including Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nRun Rudolph Run\n\"Run Rudolph Run\" is a Christmas song popularized by Chuck Berry, written by Johnny Marks and Marvin Brodie and published by St. Nicholas Music (ASCAP).

{"context": "Listed buildings in Cockermouth\nCockermouth is a civil parish and a town in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria, England.  It contains 105 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England.  Of these, six are listed at Grade I, the highest of the three grades, seven are at Grade II*, the middle grade, and the others are at Grade II, the lowest grade.  Cockermouth is a market town at the confluence of the Rivers Derwent and Cocker, and bridges crossing these rivers are listed.  The oldest surviving building is Cockermouth Castle, parts of which are in ruins, and parts are inhabited; these are all listed.  Historically the town's industries have been milling and brewing.  Former mills that have been adapted for other uses, and part of a brewery are listed.  Most of the other listed buildings are houses, cottages and associated structures.  A variety of other buildings are listed, including schools, churches, hotels, public houses, a former hospice, a milestone, a former court house, a former bank, a statue, and the town hall.\n\nCockermouth Cricket Club\nCockermouth Cricket Club was founded in the year 1823, in the historic market town of Cockermouth.  This historic year finds its place located on the crest of the club alongside: The Daffodils (of William Wordsworth fame), Cockermouth Castle and the club colours of green and gold.  The early years saw the club renting it's Sandair home from the wealthy Senhouse family.  It is commonly misconceived that the club played on the grounds in front of the large Senhouse mansion at one time but Cockermouth Cricket Club have, in its long history, only ever had one ground; Sandair.  This was eventually purchased from the Senhouse family and became property of the club.  Many photographs which adorn the walls of the current Sandair pavilion are testament to the growing interest in the area during the Victorian era.  In particular, a photograph of Cumberland versus Westmorland exists from the late 1800s fixture on the Sandair ground.\n\nCockermouth\nCockermouth is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria, England, so named because it is at the confluence of the River Cocker as it flows into the River Derwent.  The mid-2010 census estimates state that Cockermouth has a population of 8,204, increasing to 8,761 at the 2011 Census.\n\nBaron Leconfield\nBaron Leconfield, of Leconfield in the East Riding of the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.  It was created in 1859 for Col. George Wyndham (1787–1869).  He was the eldest illegitimate son and adopted heir of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1751–1837) (see Earl of Egremont for earlier history of the family), from whom he inherited Petworth House in Sussex, Egremont Castle and Cockermouth Castle in Cumbria and Leconfield Castle in Yorkshire, all formerly lands of Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670), inherited by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662–1748) on his marriage to the Percy heiress Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722) and inherited as one of the co-heirs of his son Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, 1st Earl of Egremont (1684–1750) by the latter's nephew Sir Charles Wyndham, 4th Baronet (1710–1763) of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, who inherited by special remainder the Earldom of Egremont.  The 1st Baron's eldest son, the second Baron, represented West Sussex in the House of Commons as a Conservative.  He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Sussex from 1917 to 1949.  The latter's nephew, the sixth Baron, served as Private Secretary to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan from 1957 to 1963.  In 1963, four years before he succeeded his father in the barony of Leconfield, the Egremont title held by his ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Egremont, of Petworth in the County of Sussex.  s of 2017 the titles are held by his son, the seventh Baron.  Known as \"Max Egremont\", he is a biographer and novelist.\n\nRobinson Mitchell\nRobinson Mitchell pioneered the auctioning system which is widely used today, as he realised taking bids from buyers was more efficient than the haggling between individuals which went on before.  At Cockermouth in 1865, he set up what is believed to be the first purpose-built livestock auction market in the country.  The business he founded moved their livestock operation out of town in 2002.  Sainsbury's acquired the vacated site and paid for this statue, by sculptor Liz Gwyther, to be erected outside the supermarket.  It has suffered persistent and expensive vandalism – a hand with a pointing finger has been lopped off the left arm, and a gavel prized away from the right.  A photo of how the statue used to look can be seen on the Cockermouth website.\n\nRiver Cocker, Cumbria\nThe River Cocker is a river in the Lake District in North West England, in the county of Cumbria.  Its source is at the head of the Buttermere valley.  It flows north through Buttermere and then Crummock Water, through Lorton Vale, to the town of Cockermouth, where it joins the River Derwent.  It is roughly 12 mi long.  The river takes its name from the Brythonic Celtic word \"kukrā\", meaning 'the crooked one.'\n\nWoolwich Cricket Club\nWoolwich Cricket Club was an English cricket club based in the town of Woolwich, Kent.  It was formed sometime in the first half of the 18th century, or earlier, and its earliest known record is in 1754 when its team played two major matches against the prominent Dartford Cricket Club.  The club, or at least a successor of it, then played a number of matches from 1797 to 1806 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Montpelier Cricket Club, Croydon Cricket Club and other leading town clubs.  After playing MCC in 1806, the club disappeared from the records.  Throughout the period from 1754 to 1806, Woolwich's home ground was Barrack Field, part of Woolwich Common, which remains the home ground of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC).  Mainstays of the club in its \"Napoleonic\" period were William Ayling, John Tanner and John Ward.\n\nPickwick Cricket Club\nPickwick Cricket Club is a Barbados cricket club.  The club was founded on 23 November 1882, the second oldest cricket club in Barbados after Wanderers Cricket Club.  The club's home from its foundation until 2005 was Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, the main venue for matches involving the Barbados national cricket team and the Barbados venue for Test cricket involving the West Indies cricket team.  The ground was built on land on Kensington Plantation leased by the club for a penny per annum.  Pickwick club developed Kensington Oval into the finest ground in Barbados and it soon replaced the Wanderers Ground and the Garrison Savanna as the venue for inter-colonial matches.\n\nCockermouth Castle\nCockermouth Castle (grid reference [ NY123309] ) is in the town of Cockermouth in Cumbria on a site by the junction of the Rivers Cocker and Derwent.  It is a grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Cockermouth Castle: medieval enclosure castle and site of earlier motte and bailey castle).\n\nHistory of Australian cricket\nThe History of Australian cricket begins over 200 years ago.  The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in December 1803 and a report in the Sydney Gazette on 8 January 1804 suggested that cricket was already well established in the infant colony.  By 1826, clubs including the Currency Cricket Club, the Military Cricket Club and the Australian Cricket Club had been formed.  Hyde Park and the Racecourse were the venue for these organised matches.  The formation of clubs in Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania) was not far behind with clubs formed in Hobart in 1832 and Launceston in 1843.  In Victoria in 1838, arguably Australia's most exclusive and influential cricket club was formed, the Melbourne Cricket Club.  Clubs in the other colonies followed in South Australia in 1839, and in Western Australia in 1835 a match was arranged between the labourers and mechanics against the builders of the new Government House.\n\n"}

Like all synthetic elements, it has no stable isotopes.  The first isotope to be synthesized was Rg in 1994, which is also the only directly synthesized isotope, all others are decay products of nihonium, moscovium, and tennessine.  There are 7 known radioisotopes from Rg to Rg.  The longest-lived isotope is Rg with a half-life of 2.1 minutes, although the unconfirmed Rg may have a longer half-life of about 11 minutes.\n\nRichard Dormer\nRichard Dormer (born 11 November 1969) is an actor, playwright and screenwriter from Northern Ireland.

After releasing two demos - \"Malfeitor\" (in 1991) and \"Pandemonium\" (in 1992), they changed their name to \"Battle\" and there were some line up changes at the time.  In the year of 1992 the band released the \"End of Life\" demo.  The demo contains only one song which is around 11 minutes.  The line up at the time of recording the demo was: Storm - on bass and vocals, Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm - on guitars and Jardar - on drums.  The guitars were written by Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm (1974 - 2014).  In 1993 the band changed the name to \"Strid\" which means \"Battle\" in Norwegian.  That same year, Strid re-released their \"End of Life\" demo under their new name, through the German label \"Malicious Records\".  After releasing the \"End of life\" demo, Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm left the band and was replaced by Ravn Harjar.  Through the years between 1993 and 1995, the band writes and records the self-titled EP which was released through Malicious Records and contains only two songs - \"Det hviskes blant sorte vinder\" which means \"It Is Whispered Amid the Black Winds\" in Norwegian and \"Nattevandring\" which means \"Nightwandering\" in Norwegian.  The music style and sound of this demo is more ambient/atmospheric black metal oriented.  Mainly because of this release, the band is commonly recognised as the creators of depressive black metal along with some other bands from the second wave of black metal music.  At this time the band line up contains: Ravn Harjar - on guitars, Storm - on bass and vocals and Jardar - on drums.  After the releasing of the self-titled EP, there was no any official releases by the band.  There are also bootleg releases that came out through the years like the CD from 2005 by Ars Mysteriorum and LP, each featuring both \"End of Life\" and the self - titled EP tracks.  In the year of 2001 the original former member of \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\", bass player and vocalist - Storm committed suicide.  In the year of 2007, the Greek label Kyrck Productions & Armour re-released all the previous material released by the band from the past which contains all \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\" material.  Somewhere between 2009 and 2010 there was a reunion of the band with old members including Vicotnik (Dødheimsgard, ex-Aphrodisiac, ex-Ved Buens Ende, ex-Manes, ex-Code, ex-Naer Mataron, ex-Endwarfment).  Another member that was part of the reunion was Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm - the main composer of the \"End of Life\" track.  In 2014 Lars Fredrik Bergstrøm died.  At this time the band line up contains Ravn Harjar - on guitars and vocals, Vicotnik - on bass and Sigmund (ex-Inflabitan, ex-Dødheimsgard) - on guitars.  In January 2015, Ravn Harjar wrote a statement on the official Strid Facebook page that in the autumn of the year 2015 the band will start recording their first full-length album which will be titled \"Endetid\".  That means \"End of times\" in Norwegian.\n\n"}

{"context": "Blaise Pascal\nBlaise Pascal ( ; ] ; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic theologian.  He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen.  Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli.  Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method.\n\nKatal\nThe katal (symbol: kat) is the SI unit of catalytic activity.  It is a derived SI unit for quantifying the catalytic activity of enzymes (measuring the enzymatic activity level in enzyme catalysis) and other catalysts. Its use is recommended by the \"General Conference on Weights and Measures\" and other international organizations.  It replaces the non-SI \"enzyme unit\".  Enzyme units are, however, still more commonly used than the katal in practice at present, especially in biochemistry.\n\nLumen second\nIn photometry, the lumen second (lm s or lm⋅s) is the SI derived unit of luminous energy.  It is based on the lumen, the SI unit of luminous flux, and the second, the SI base unit of time.\n\nCandela per square metre\nThe candela per square metre (cd/m) is the derived SI unit of luminance.  The unit is based on the candela, the SI unit of luminous intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area.\n\nDay\nA day is a unit of time.  In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon.  The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \"solar day\".  Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience.  In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time.  The unit of measurement \"day\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \"d\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI.  A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time.  The word \"day\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\"  The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms).\n\nPascal (unit)\nThe pascal (symbol: Pa) is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure, stress, Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength.  It is defined as one newton per square metre.  It is named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal.\n\nGram per litre\nA gram per litre or gram per liter (g/L or g/l) is a unit of measurement of mass concentration that shows how many grams of a certain substance are present in one litre of a usually liquid or gaseous mixture.  It is not an SI unit - the SI unit of mass concentration is kilogram per cubic metre, which is equivalent (1 g/L = 1 kg/m).\n\nMinute\nThe minute is a unit of time or of angle.  As a unit of time, the minute is equal to ⁄ (the first sexagesimal fraction) of an hour, or 60 seconds.  In the UTC time standard, a minute on rare occasions has 61 seconds, a consequence of leap seconds (there is a provision to insert a negative leap second, which would result in a 59-second minute, but this has never happened in more than 40 years under this system).  As a unit of angle, the minute of arc is equal to ⁄ of a degree, or 60 seconds (of arc).  Although not an SI unit for either time or angle, the minute is accepted for use with SI units for both.  The SI symbols for \"minute\" or \"minutes\" are min for time measurement, and the prime symbol after a number, e.g. 5′, for angle measurement.  The prime is also sometimes used informally to denote minutes of time.\n\nBarn (unit)\nA barn (symbol: b) is a unit of area equal to 10 m (100 fm).  Originally used in nuclear physics for expressing the cross sectional area of nuclei and nuclear reactions, today it is also used in all fields of high-energy physics to express the cross sections of any scattering process, and is best understood as a measure of the probability of interaction between small particles.  A barn is approximately the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.  The barn is also the unit of area used in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance to quantify the interaction of a nucleus with an electric field gradient.  While the barn is not an SI unit, the SI standards body accepts its use with SI units due to its continued use in particle physics.\n\nMagnetic complex reluctance\nMagnetic complex reluctance (SI Unit: H) is a measurement of a passive magnetic circuit (or element within that circuit) dependent on sinusoidal magnetomotive force (SI Unit: At·Wb) and sinusoidal magnetic flux (SI Unit: T·m), and this is determined by deriving the ratio of their complex \"effective\" amplitudes.

Organised by the English Football League (EFL), it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system – 92 clubs in total – comprising the top level Premier League, and the three divisions of the English Football League's own league competition (Championship, League One and League Two).\n\n2017–18 A.F.C. Bournemouth season\nThe 2017–18 A.F.C. Bournemouth season is the club's 3rd consecutive season in the top flight of English football and their 128th year in existence.  This season Bournemouth will participate in the Premier League as well as the FA Cup and EFL Cup.\n\n2014–15 Arsenal F.C. season\nThe 2014–15 season was Arsenal's 23rd season in the Premier League and 95th consecutive season in the top flight of English football.  This season Arsenal participated in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and the UEFA Champions League.  An inconsistent start to the league season ended any realistic hopes for the Premier League title as Arsenal only won two out of their first eight games.  Inconsistency plagued Arsenal throughout the first half of the campaign, not helped by numerous injuries to important players.  At one stage, Arsenal were as low as eighth heading into early December.  This would later haunt them as they mounted a superb recovery during the second half of the season where they won eight league games in a row, becoming the in-form side of the division.  Ultimately, however, the gap between themselves and leaders Chelsea was too much, the points dropped during the inconsistent first half of the season proving too much to recover.  Old habits were hard to eradicate in Europe as yet again, Arsenal were their own worst enemies.  Despite being widely expected to reach the quarter-finals, having been given a favourable draw in the Round of 16 against AS Monaco, Arsenal self-destructed at home, where panic led to Monaco winning the first leg 1–3, a scoreline which ultimately proved fatal over the course of the tie.  Arsenal, with their 0–2 away win proving useless, bowed out yet again in the round of sixteen for the fifth consecutive year.  However, Arsenal reclaimed the FA Cup, thus becoming the most successful club in the history of the competition with twelve wins, comfortably beating Aston Villa 4–0 in the final.  Arsenal finished the league season in third, thereby qualifying directly to Champions league group stage and avoiding the Champions League qualifier, something Arsène Wenger was keen to avoid as he felt it had a negative impact on competing for the Premier League title, which was the primary target set by the players, manager and coaching staff, going into the next season.\n\n2017–18 Manchester United F.C. season\nThe 2017–18 season is Manchester United's 26th season in the Premier League and their 43rd consecutive season in the top flight of English football.  The club will participate in the Premier League, FA Cup, EFL Cup (as holders), UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup.\n\nEFL Trophy\nThe EFL Trophy (English Football League Trophy) is an annual English association football knockout competition open to the 48 clubs in EFL League One and EFL League Two, the third and fourth tiers of the English football league system and, since the 2016–17 season, 16 under-21 sides from Premier League and EFL Championship clubs.  It is the third most prestigious knockout trophy in English football after the FA Cup and EFL Cup (League Cup).\n\nList of EFL Cup finals\nThe EFL Cup is a knockout cup competition in English football organised by and named after the English Football League (EFL).  The competition was established in 1960 and is considered to be the second-most important domestic cup competition for English football clubs, after the FA Cup.  The competition is open to all 72 members of the English Football League and the 20 members of the Premier League.  For the first six seasons of the competition, the final was contested over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium.  The first Football League Cup was won by Aston Villa, who beat Rotherham United 3–2 on aggregate, after losing the first leg 2–0.  The competition's first single-legged final was held in 1967: Queens Park Rangers defeated West Bromwich Albion 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\n2010–11 A.F.C. Bournemouth season\nThe 2010–11 A.F.C. Bournemouth season is the club's first season back in Football League One after a two-year absence.  During the 2010–11 English football season, Bournemouth will participate in League One, the Johnstones Paint Trophy, the FA Cup, and the Football League Cup.  Bournemouth were eliminated from the League Cup and the Johnstones Paint Trophy in the First Round and the FA Cup in the Second Round\n\n2012–13 Arsenal F.C. season\nThe 2012–13 season was Arsenal Football Club's 21st season in the Premier League and 93rd consecutive season in the top flight of English football.  Arsenal participated in the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, after finishing third in the previous Premier League season.  The League Cup however was out of their reach, and despite an entertaining cup run, which included 13 goals scored in two games, Arsenal lost to fourth-division Bradford City in the quarter-finals on penalties.  In the FA Cup, Arsenal were knocked out by Championship side Blackburn Rovers in the fifth round.  The Champions League also proved fruitless, as despite a valiant effort in Bavaria winning 2–0, they were ultimately knocked out on the away goals rule against Bayern Munich, thus extending their trophy drought for an eighth season.  The highest scoring game in their season was the famous 7–5 win in the League Cup (after extra time), where they came back from 4 goals down to beat Reading.  Arsenal's highest scoring league win was the 7–3 win against Newcastle United in December.  This season, Arsenal finished fourth after having to close another large points gap (like last season) between themselves and their North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n2016–17 A.F.C. Bournemouth season\nThe 2016–17 season is AFC Bournemouth's second consecutive season in the Premier League and their 127th year in existence.  This season Bournemouth will participate in the Premier League, FA Cup and Football League Cup.\n\nFA Cup\nThe FA Cup, known officially as The Football Association Challenge Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic English football.  First played during the 1871–72 season, it is the oldest association football competition in the world.  It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA).  For sponsorship reasons, from 2015 through to 2018 it is also known as The Emirates FA Cup.  A concurrent women's tournament is also held, the FA Women's Cup.\n\n"}

It was a single from his debut album, \"2Pacalypse Now\".  The first verse tells a story of 2Pac being harassed by the police, one even shooting at him.  He then fires back and says he did it because he was tired of constantly being profiled and abused by police officers.  2Pac then depicts the police chasing after him and eventually cornering him.  He then ends the song with the line \"I'd rather die then be trapped in the living hell\", implying if forced into a corner he would rather die than live life in a cell.\n\nMy Homies\nMy Homies is the fifth studio album by American rapper Scarface.

It is predominantly produced by B Wiz and only held two guest appearances from Ras Kass and Kool Keith.  It was produced mostly by Chino's close associates, and the lyrical content revolved around dark, hardcore themes (mostly metaphorical braggadoccio), dismissing the commercialized hip hop that was starting to gain momentum at this time.  It contains the infamous but well-known song \"Riiiot!\"  which had a line that possibly alluded to the rumor of West Coast rapper 2Pac being raped in prison.  2Pac later called him out on \"Hit Em Up,\" and Chino responded with a freestyle dis.  Chino himself stated that the line was not meant as a dis, and he and 2Pac were on good terms at the time of his death.\n\n"}
{"context": "Ceratozamia\nCeratozamia is a genus of New World cycads in the family Zamiaceae.  The genus contains 27 known currently living species and one or two fossil species.  Most species are endemic to mountainous areas of Mexico, while few species extend into the mountains of Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.  The genus name comes from the Greek \"ceras\", meaning horn, which refers to the paired, spreading horny projections on the male and female sporophylls of all species.\n\nBanksiamyces\nBanksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae.  The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or \"cones\" of various species of \"Banksia\", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia.  Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10 mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the \"Banksia\" fruit.  The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits.  The first specimens of \"Banksiamyces\", known then as \"Tympanis toomansis\", were described in 1887.  Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, \"B. katerinae\", \"B. macrocarpus\", and \"B. toomansis\".  A fourth species, \"B. maccannii\", was added in 1984.\n\nMegalurus\nMegalurus is a genus of passerine bird in the family Locustellidae.  The genus was once placed in the Old World warbler \"wastebin\" family Sylviidae.  The genus contains six species also known as the typical grassbirds.  The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics.  The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand.  The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea.  The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands.  Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings.  Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens.\n\nList of Amanita species\nThe following is a list of some notable species of the agaric genus \"Amanita\".  This genus contains over 500 named species and varieties, but the list is far from exhaustive.  The list follows the classification of subgenera and sections of \"Amanita\" outline by Corner and Bas; Bas, as used by Tulloss (2007) and modified by Redhead & al. (2016) for \"Amanita\" subgenus \"Amanitina\" and Singer for \"Amanita\" section \"Roanokenses\".  Bolding of the species name and an asterisk (*) following indicates the species is the type species of that section, with a double asterisk (**) indicating the type species of the entire genus.  Use of common names follows Tulloss (2007), Holden (2003), Arora (1986), and Lincoff (1981).\n\nAsarina\nAsarina is a flowering plant genus of only one species, Asarina procumbens, the trailing snapdragon, which is native to southern Europe.  Originally placed in the Scrophulariaceae (figwort family), the genus has more recently been moved to the Plantaginaceae (plantain family).  Species from North America formerly placed in the genus \"Asarina\" are now placed in \"Holmgrenanthe\", \"Lophospermum\", \"Mabrya\" and \"Maurandya\", as well as \"Neogaerrhinum\".  \"Asarina\" is now regarded as exclusively an Old World genus.\n\nPachyornis\nPachyornis is an extinct genus of ratites from New Zealand which belonged to the moa family.  Like all ratites it was a member of the order Struthioniformes.  The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel.  They also have a distinctive palate.  This genus contains three species, and are part of the Anomalopteryginae or lesser moa subfamily.  \"Pachyornis\" moa were the stoutest and most heavy-legged genus of the family.  The most notable species being \"Pachyornis elephantopus\" - the Heavy-Footed Moa.  They were generally similar to the Eastern Moa or the Broad-billed moa of the genus \"Euryapteryx\", but differed in having a pointed bill and being more heavyset in general.  At least one species (\"P. australis\") is assumed to have had a crest of long feathers on its head.  The species became rapidly extinct following human colonization of New Zealand, with the possible exception of \"P. australis\", which may have already been extinct by then.\n\nCalyptocephalellidae\nThe Calyptocephalellidae are a family of toads found in Chile containing two genera, \"Calyptocephalella\" and \"Telmatobufo\".  The \"Calyptocephalella\" genus contains one species, \"C. gayi\", the helmeted water toad, which is a large aquatic toad weighing up to 0.5 kg .  The \"Telmatobufo\" genus contains four species, \"T. australis\", \"T. bullocki\", \"T. ignotus\", and \"T. venustus\".  All species within the family are considered threatened, with \"T. bullocki\" and \"T. venustus\" being classified as critically endangered.\n\nWigandia\nWigandia is a genus of flowering plants within the waterleaf subfamily, Hydrophylloideae.  They are found mainly in Central America and South America, though one or two species are found as far north as the United States.  Some are grown as ornamental plants and will flourish in most Mediterranean or temperate regions.  The genus is named for Johann Wigand (ca. 1523-1587), German Lutheran cleric and theologian, and Bishop of Pomesania.\n\nLeptofoenus\nLeptofoenus is a genus of wasp in the family Pteromalidae, the type genus subfamily Leptofoeninae found in South, Central, and southern North America.  The genus contains five living species and one extinct species known from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola.  With body sizes ranging from 11 - \"Leptofoenus\" species are larger than nearly all other species in Pteromalidae.  The genus bears a notable resemblance to the wasp families Pelecinidae, Gasteruptiidae, and Stephanidae.\n\nLophodermium\nLophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae.  The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution.  Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves.  In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter.  In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens.  The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera.  Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations.  In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.\n\n"}

Asturias makes early use of a literary technique now known as magic realism.  One of the most notable works of the dictator novel genre, \"El Señor Presidente\" developed from an earlier Asturias short story, written to protest social injustice in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in the author's home town.\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias\nMiguel Ángel Asturias Rosales (October 19, 1899 – June 9, 1974) was a Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan poet-diplomat, novelist, playwright and journalist.  Asturias helped establish Latin American literature's contribution to mainstream Western culture, and at the same time drew attention to the importance of indigenous cultures, especially those of his native Guatemala.\n\nRafael Arévalo Martínez\nRafael Arévalo Martínez (25 July 1884, Guatemala City –12 June 1975, Guatemala City) was a Guatemalan writer.  He was a novelist, short-story writer, poet, diplomat, and director of Guatemala’s national library for more than 20 years.  Though Arévalo Martínez’s fame has waned, he is still considered important because of his short stories, and one in particular: \"The man who resembled a horse\" and the biography of president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, \"¡Ecce Pericles!\" .  Arévalo Martínez was director of the Guatemalan National Library from 1926 until 1946, when he became for a year Guatemala’s representative before the Pan American Union in Washington, D.C. He was the political and literary counterpart of his more famous countryman, Nobel Prize winner Miguel Ángel Asturias; while Arévalo Martínez was an unapologetic admirer of the United States, Asturias was a bitter critic of the New Orleans-based United Fruit Company (now part of United Brands Company), which he felt had plundered his country.\n\n"}

{"context": "Japanese popular culture\nJapanese popular culture encompasses the modern popular culture of Japan.  It includes Japanese cinema, cuisine, television programs, anime, manga and music, all of which retain older artistic and literary traditions, and many of their themes and styles of presentation can be traced to traditional art forms.  Contemporary forms of popular culture, much like the traditional forms, are not only forms of entertainment but also aspects to distinguish contemporary Japan from the rest of the modern world.  There is a large industry of music, films, and the products of a huge comic book industry, among other forms of entertainment.  Game centers, bowling alleys, and karaoke parlors are well-known hangout places for teens while older people may play \"shogi\" or \"go\" in specialized parlors.\n\nJazz\nJazz is a music genre that originated in African American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.  Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression.  It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation.  Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.  Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.  Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.  Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\".\n\nChinese opera\nTraditional Chinese opera (), or Xiqu, is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China.  It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty.  Early forms of Chinese theater are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become traditional Chinese opera.\n\nUK Centre for Carnival Arts\nThe UK Centre for Carnival Arts (UKCCA) is a home dedicated to carnival arts, communities, learning and enterprise.

It is a solid state amplifier designed for Jazz, Blues, Rock and Heavy metal musicians.\n\nGolden Throats\nGolden Throats is Rhino Records' series of humorous compilations of critically lambasted cover versions of songs, performed mostly either by celebrities known for something other than musical talent or musicians not known for the genre from which the song they are covering comes.  For example, William Shatner sings (or, more precisely, does a dramatic reading of the lyrics to) \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" Leonard Nimoy sings \"If I Had a Hammer,\" and Muhammad Ali sings \"Stand by Me.\"  Other examples include the Bing Crosby cover of the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" and the Mel Tormé cover of Donovan's \"Sunshine Superman,\" as both were rock songs being covered by musicians of an older generation.  In most cases, the songs appear to be performed sincerely, rather than in a spirit of irony or intentional goofiness.  In many respects, these albums were among the first to anthologize lounge music, with their focus on \"light\" versions of contemporary hits.  The series (of four albums) was created and produced by long-time Rhino staffer Gary Peterson and pop culture historian Pat Sierchio.  Each release contained liner notes penned by acclaimed music historian Irwin Chusid, and most featured original art by Drew Friedman.  The cover art parodied well-known albums (\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\", \"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo\", and the Beatles' infamous \"butcher\" cover for \"Yesterday And Today\").  The notoriety of the series no doubt contributed to William Shatner's decision to relaunch his musical career.\n\nAmerican Primitive Guitar\nAmerican Primitive Guitar is a music genre which was first originated by John Fahey in the late 1950s/early 1960s.  Although increasingly confused in recent years, American Primitive Guitar is distinct and different from \"American Primitivism\", which refers to certain painting and sculptural art forms which arose in the 1890s.\n\nSouth African art\nSouth African art is the visual art produced by the people inhabiting the geographical location of South Africa.  The oldest art objects in the world were discovered in a South African cave.  \"Archaeologists have discovered two sets of art kits thought to be 100,000 years old at a cave in South Africa.  The findings provide a glimpse into how early humans produced and stored ochre – a form of paint – which pushes back our understanding of when evolved complex cognition occurred by around 20,000 – 30,000 years.  Also, dating from 75,000 years ago, they found small drilled snail shells could have no other function than to have been strung on a string as a necklace.  South Africa was one of the cradles of the human species.  The scattered tribes of Khoisan and San peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings.  They were superseded by Bantu and Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms.  In the present era, traditional tribal forms of art were scattered and re-melded by the divisive policies of apartheid.  New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes.  In addition to this, there also is the Dutch-influenced folk art of the hardy Afrikaner Trek Boers and the urban white artists earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, making for an eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.\n\nLaïko\nLaïkó (Greek: λαϊκό τραγούδι , ] , \"song of the people\"; \"popular song\", pl: \"laïká\" [\"tragoudia\"]), is a Greek music genre composed in Greek language in accordance with the tradition of the Greek people.

George Austen and Cassandra Leigh, Jane Austen's parents, lived in Steventon, Hampshire, where Rev. Austen was the rector of the Anglican parish from 1765 until 1801.  Jane Austen's immediate family was large and close-knit.  She had six brothers—James, George, Charles, Francis, Henry, and Edward—and a beloved older sister, Cassandra.  Austen's brother Edward was adopted by Thomas and Elizabeth Knight and eventually inherited their estates at Godmersham, Kent, and Chawton, Hampshire.  In 1801, Rev. Austen retired from the ministry and moved his family to Bath, Somerset.  He died in 1805 and for the next four years, Jane, Cassandra, and their mother lived first in rented quarters and then in Southampton where they shared a house with Frank Austen's family.  During these unsettled years, they spent much time visiting various branches of the family.  In 1809, Jane, Cassandra, and their mother moved permanently into a large \"cottage\" in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate.

This was an extremely rare case as the law in Pennsylvania says that if you have been charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder and were given a life sentence, there is no possibility for parole (Gottschalk).  He is most known as an ex-convict who was released from Prison after serving 36 years of what was supposed to be a life sentence.

Helmuth Buxbaum had taken out a $1 million life insurance policy on his wife shortly before her murder.  The Crown attorney prosecuting the case argued that Buxbaum had hired a hitman to kill his wife for $10,000 and had pulled over to the side of the road so that the man could drag her out of the car and shoot her.  The gunman, Gary Foshay, was convicted of second degree murder.  Buxbaum was convicted after a high-profile trial and sentenced to a life sentence without the possibility of parole for 25 years.

{"context": "Associahedron\nIn mathematics, an associahedron \"K\" is an (\"n\" − 2)-dimensional convex polytope in which each vertex corresponds to a way of correctly inserting opening and closing parentheses in a word of \"n\" letters and the edges correspond to single application of the associativity rule.  Equivalently, the vertices of an associahedron correspond to the triangulations of a regular polygon with \"n\" + 1 sides and the edges correspond to edge flips in which a single diagonal is removed from a triangulation and replaced by a different diagonal.  Associahedra are also called Stasheff polytopes after the work of Jim Stasheff, who rediscovered them in the early 1960s after earlier work on them by Dov Tamari.\n\nVern Riffe State Office Tower\nThe Vern Riffe State Office Tower is a 503-foot-tall (153 m) skyscraper in Columbus, Ohio.  It was completed in 1988 and has 32 floors.  NBBJ designed the building, which is the fifth-tallest in Columbus, and has 102,192 m² of floor area.  An earlier concept for the site, also designed by NBBJ, would have included a site to the west of the present location, and would have effectively closed off South Wall Street north of West State Street.  The building was named for Vernal G. Riffe, Jr, who served as Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1975 to 1994.  The complex also contains the 854-seat Capitol Theatre.\n\nThe War of the Roses (film)\nThe War of the Roses is a 1989 American black comedy film based upon the 1981 novel of the same name\" by Warren Adler.  The film follows a wealthy couple with a seemingly perfect marriage.  When their marriage begins to fall apart, material possessions become the center of an outrageous and bitter divorce battle.\n\nWar of the Roses (Pennsylvania)\nThe South Central Pennsylvania cities of Lancaster and York have a historical rivalry in all sporting events from the high-school level to the professional.  Since both cities are named after the English cities of Lancaster and York, the former Pennsylvania baseball teams were named for the opposing sides of the Wars of the Roses.  As a metaphor, \"War of the Roses\" describes the intense baseball matches fought between the Lancaster Red Roses and the York White Roses.  With the addition of York to the Atlantic League, the Barnstormers continue the Red Roses' tradition as they battle the York Revolution for lower Susquehanna supremacy.\n\nDyson sphere\nA Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures most or all of its power output.  The first known mention of the concept of a star enclosed by a sphere was in an early Indo-European religious creation myth which described the prenatal sun as being enclosed (imprisoned) by rock.  The first contemporary description of the structure was by Olaf Stapledon in his science fiction novel \"Star Maker\" (1937), in which he described \"worlds constructed of a series of concentric spheres\" and a similar galactic-scale natural formation of a \"rocky sphere that had once been a galaxy.\"  The concept was later popularized by Freeman Dyson in his 1960 paper \"Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\".  Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival.  He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent extraterrestrial life.  Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the Kardashev scale.\n\nMercedes-Benz G500 4×4²\nMercedes-Benz G500 4×4² was an earlier concept vehicle bought into production in 2015.  The vehicle was fitted with 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 petrol engine delivering 416 bhp and 450 lb ft of torque.  The model is the shorter and practical version of Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG 6x6.\n\nGröbner fan\nIn computer algebra, the Gröbner fan of an ideal in the ring of polynomials is a concept in the theory of Gröbner bases.  It is defined to be a fan consisting of cones that correspond to different monomial orders on that ideal.  The concept has been introduced by Mora and Robbiano in 1988.\n\nPost-Resurrection appearances of Jesus\nThe post-resurrection appearances of Jesus are the earthly appearances of Jesus to his followers after his death, burial and resurrection.  Believers point to them as proof of the Resurrection of Jesus and his identity as Messiah, seated in heaven on the right hand of God (the doctrine of the Exaltation of Christ).  There is a strong early tradition that the family and immediate followers of Jesus, and the Paul the Apostle, had visionary and mystical experiences of Jesus after his death.  Several decades later, when the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were being written, the emphasis had shifted to the physical nature of the resurrection, while still overlapping with the earlier concept of a divine exaltation of Jesus' soul.  This development can be linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul and the earliest Christ-followers were Jewish, and Second Temple Judaism emphasised the life of the soul; the gospel-writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and deified in his physical body.\n\nReferential density\nReferential density is a concept of ficto-narrative theory put forward by Thomas G. Pavel in his 1986 book, \"Fictional Worlds\".  The concept refers to the referential relationship of a text to a fictional world, the ontology of which can be established by a possible worlds approach.  A large text that refers to a small fictional world is said to have low referential density, whereas a small text referring to a large fictional world has high referential density.  The size of the text is measured in abstract terms as amplitude, which in most cases will correspond to its physical length; exceptions to this may arise in cases of embedded discourses, such as metanarratives (or imaging digressions), which refer to the actual world.  For this reason, the form and genre of a fictional work provide only an approximate indication of its size; by the same token, it is possible to refer to the size and referential density of part of a fictional work.  The size of a fictional world, in turn, is measured in terms of the sum total of properties applicable to the objects and agents inhabiting the fictional world.\n\nBlack comedy\nBlack comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo.  Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes.  Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.\n\n"}
{"context": "Cultural schema theory\nCultural schema theory (Nishida, 1999) explains the familiar and pre-acquainted knowledge one uses when entering a familiar situation in his/her own culture.  Cultural schemas for social interaction are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment.  Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviors in familiar situations.  Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000).  Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000).  Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same culture in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).\n\nCrosswind kite power\nCrosswind kite power is power derived from a class of airborne wind-energy conversion systems (AWECS, aka AWES) or crosswind kite power systems (CWKPS) characterized by a kite system that has energy-harvesting parts that fly transverse to the direction of the ambient wind, i.e., to crosswind mode; sometimes the entire wing set and tether set is flown in crosswind mode.  These systems at many scales from toy to power-grid-feeding sizes may be used as high-altitude wind power (HAWP) devices or low-altitude wind power (LAWP) devices without having to use towers.  Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system.  A tethered wing, flying in crosswind at many times wind speed, harvests wind power from an area that is many times exceeding the wing’s own area.  Crosswind kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines: access to more powerful and stable wind resource, high capacity factor, capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs, and no need for a tower.  Additionally, the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency; the movement of crosswinding tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades.  However, a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to crosswind and is a form of crosswind kite power.  Miles L. Loyd furthered studies on crosswind kite power systems in his work \"Crosswind Kite Power\" in 1980.  Some believe that crosswind kite power was introduced by P. Payne and C. McCutchen in their patent No. 3,987,987, filed in 1975, however, crosswind kite power was used far before such patent, e.g., in target kites for war-target practice where the crosswinding power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners.\n\nEsviken\nEsviken (formerly Esvigen) is a villa surrounded by an elaborate garden and a former agricultural property in Asker, Norway.  Industrialist Halvor Schou bought Løkenes farm with 1000 daa land in the late 1860s, and commissioned the villa, designed by famous architect Wilhelm von Hanno.  Esviken was used as a summer residence by Schou and his heirs.  His daughter Birgitte Halvordine Schou (b. 1857) was married to industrialist Einar Westye Egeberg, who inherited the villa and half of the property.  Their daughter Hermine Egeberg (1881–1974) was married from 1901 to Count Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg.  Wedel-Jarlsberg was Lord Chamberlain for King Haakon VII of Norway from 1931 to 1945 and one of the King's closest confidants for over thirty year, and the King and Queen visited Esviken many times.  Esviken is also located in close proximity to Skaugum, owned by the royal family.  Their oldest son Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg, the later Count and owner of Jarlsberg, was born at Esviken in 1902.  Formally, Hermine and Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg took over the property in 1930, but in reality, this happened around thirty years earlier.  The Wedel-Jarlsberg family extended the garden significantly.  In 1960, the property was inherited by their daughter Hedevig Wedel-Jarlsberg (1913–96), married Paus, and her husband Per (Christian Cornelius) Paus, who was himself a descendant of the Schou family (Halvor Schou's first cousin) and his wife's distant cousin.  In 1996, their children Cornelia Paus, Christopher Paus and Peder Nicolas Paus inherited the property.  It was sold to Asker municipality in 1999.  The villa and the garden was listed as a protected cultural heritage site by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 2006.\n\nThomas de Multon, 1st Baron Multon of Gilsland\nLord Thomas de Moulton (1276–1322) was the first Baron Multon of Gilsland.  He married Eleanor de Burgh, daughter of Richard de Burgh 2nd Earl of Ulster; Richard's other daughter, Elizabeth de Burgh, married King Robert the Bruce of Scotland.  On 26 August 1307, Thomas de Moulton was summoned to parliament as Baron Moulton of Gilsland, the only creation of that title in the Peerage of England.  He was engaged in many of the Scottish wars and subsequently obtained many immunities from the crown in the shape of grants for fairs and markets upon his many manors.  He died on 26 November 1313 leaving an only daughter and heiress, Margaret, who inherited the title and estates and was later nicknamed the \"Flower of Gillesland\".  She married Ranulph (Ralph) de Dacre, whom she married because she found him chivalrous.  Her father originally opposed the match, but relented when he discovered that the Dacre family was equal to his own in wealth and power, according to the Moulton Annals.  Ranulph was later summoned to parliament as Lord Dacre in 1321.  The title and estates after Margaret's death in 1361 were inherited by the Dacre family.\n\nSigismund II Augustus\nSigismund II Augustus (Polish: \"Zygmunt II August\" , Ruthenian: \"Żygimont II Awgust\", Lithuanian: \"Žygimantas II Augustas\" , German: \"Sigismund II.  August\" ) (1 August 1520 – 7 July 1572) was the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, the only son of Sigismund I the Old, whom Sigismund II succeeded in 1548.  Married three times, the last of the Jagiellons remained childless, and through the Union of Lublin introduced a free elective monarchy.\n\nStanislovas Goštautas\nStanislovas Goštautas (also called Stanisław Gasztołd or \"Gasztołt\" of Abdank in Polish) (ca. 1507 in Vilnius – 1542) was a notable member of the Lithuanian nobility and a high-ranking member of the Lithuanian administration.  Born to Albertas Goštautas, the Voivode of Vilnius and Princess Sofia of Vereya, he was the last direct male descendant of the – once mighty – Goštautai family.\n\nRook and bishop versus rook endgame\nThe rook and bishop versus rook endgame is a chess endgame where one player has just a rook, bishop and king, and the other player has only a rook and king.  It has been studied many times through the years.  This combination of material is one of the most common pawnless chess endgames.  It is generally a theoretical draw, but the rook and bishop have good winning chances in practice because the defense is difficult.  Ulf Andersson won the position twice within a year, once against a grandmaster and once against a candidate grandmaster; and grandmaster Keith Arkell has won it 18 times out of 18 .  In positions that have a forced win, up to 59 moves are required .  Tony Kosten has seen the endgame many times in master games, with the stronger side almost always winning .  Pal Benko called this the \"headache ending\" .\n\nInverse gambler's fallacy\nThe inverse gambler's fallacy, named by philosopher Ian Hacking, is a formal fallacy of Bayesian inference which is an inverse of the better known gambler's fallacy.  It is the fallacy of concluding, on the basis of an unlikely outcome of a random process, that the process is likely to have occurred many times before.  For example, if one observes a pair of fair dice being rolled and turning up double sixes, it is wrong to suppose that this lends any support to the hypothesis that the dice have been rolled many times before.  We can see this from the Bayesian update rule: letting \"U\" denote the unlikely outcome of the random process and \"M\" the proposition that the process has occurred many times before, we have\n\nAleksander Chodkiewicz\nAleksander Chodkiewicz (Lithuanian: \"Aleksandras Chodkevičius\" , Belarusian: Аляксандар Хадкевіч ; ca. 1475 – 28 May 1549) was a noble from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, founder of the Supraśl Orthodox Monastery.  He inherited vast possessions from his father Ivan Chodkiewicz, which made him 11th wealthiest person in the Grand Duchy according to the military census of 1528.  Via his mother Jawnuta (Agnieszka) of the Belsky family, he was second cousin to Kings of Poland John I Albert, Alexander Jagiellon, and Sigismund I the Old.  Chodkiewicz quickly gained influence under Alexander Jagiellon, becoming royal marshal.  However, after Alexander's's death in 1506 his career stagnated.  He supported Queen Bona Sforza, gaining her favor and becoming starost of Brest in 1528.  The peak of his career came in 1544 when young Sigismund II Augustus, still influenced by his mother, appointed Chodkiewicz as voivode of Nowogródek and his son Hieronim as castellan of Trakai.\n\nGoštautai\nGoštautai (Lithuanian plural form), masculine Goštautas and feminine form Goštautaitė (\"Polish\" original, after Kasper Niesiecki - Gastoldowie, later transformed into Gasztołdowie) were a Lithuanian noble family, one of the most influential magnate families during the 15th and early 16th centuries.  Their only serious rivals were the Kęsgailos, and from the end of the 15th century the fast rising in power and influence Radziwiłł family clan.  It appears from the Latin original spelling of their name Gastoldus which is a variation of \"castaldius\" that they had been close to the Grand Dukes and that their function was to oversee ducal demesne.  Most power family gained during the reign of Casimir Jagiellon.  The castaldius of Vytautas, Andrius Goštautas might have been a voivode of Vilnius and Kreva, and father of Jonas, appears to have been the precursor of the family growth.  The majority of the family's possessions (lands) were in the western part of the Duchy and eastern ethnic Lithuania.  After the death of the last scion of the family, Stanislovas Goštautas, the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus inherited his possessions as a matter of right, per Grand Duchy of Lithuania law.\n\n"}

Air traffic obstacles have to be marked in most cases with red and white colored markings and with aircraft warning lights at night.  On larger structures blinking lights are required.  An example of an air traffic obstacle is the air traffic control tower.\n\nNATS Holdings\nNATS Holdings, formerly National Air Traffic Services and commonly referred to as NATS, is the main Air Navigation Service Provider in the United Kingdom.  It inherited the traditions of UK air traffic control, which (founded over Croydon Airport) was the world's first air traffic control regime.  It provides en-route air traffic control services to flights within the UK Flight Information Regions and the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area, and provides air traffic control services to fourteen UK airports.\n\nControl zone\nA control zone (CTR or controlled traffic region) in aviation is a volume of controlled airspace, normally around an airport, which extends from the \"surface\" to a \"specified upper limit\", established to protect air traffic operating to and from that airport.  Because CTRs are, by definition, controlled airspace, aircraft can only fly in it after receiving a specific clearance from air traffic control.

FAA ATC facilities include Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC); Terminal Radar Control facility (TRACON), Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), Flight Service Stations (FSS), or the Air Traffic Control System Command Center(ATCSCC).  The term is defined in FAA Order JO 1900.47, Air Traffic Control Operational Contingency Plans.  It is one of three designations used by the FAA (ATC Alert, ATC Limited, and ATC Zero) to describe degraded operations and invoke operational contingency plans.\n\nAir traffic controller\nAir traffic controllers are personnel responsible for the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic in the global air traffic control system.  Usually stationed in air traffic control centers and control towers on the ground, they monitor the position, speed, and altitude of aircraft in their assigned airspace visually and by radar, and give directions to the pilots by radio.  The position of air traffic controller is one that requires highly specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Controllers apply separation rules to keep aircraft at a safe distance from each other in their area of responsibility and move all aircraft safely and efficiently through their assigned sector of airspace, as well as on the ground.  Because controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty (often in aviation, \"on position\") and make countless real-time decisions on a daily basis, the ATC profession is consistently regarded around the world as one of the most mentally challenging careers, and can be notoriously stressful depending on many variables (equipment, configurations, weather, traffic volume, human factors, etc.).  Many controllers, however, would cite high salaries, and a very large, unique, and privileged degree of autonomy as major advantages of their jobs.\n\n"}

Barker (June 4, 1899 – January 13, 1939) was an American criminal, the son of Ma Barker and a member of the Barker-Karpis gang, founded by his brother Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis.  Generally known as \"Doc\", Barker was typically called on for violent action, while Fred and Karpis planned the gang's crimes.  He was arrested and convicted of kidnapping in 1935.  Sent to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1936, he was killed three years later while attempting to escape from the Rock.\n\nBarker–Karpis gang\nThe Barker-Karpis Gang was one of the longest-lived criminal gangs during the Depression Era, spanning from 1931 to 1935.

Two escapees were shot, and one died of his wounds; all surviving were quickly recaptured.  Two at least, Young and Rufus McCain, received sentences of solitary confinement, and served them at Alcatraz for a period of a three year (until autumn of 1942).  A little over three year after his reentering the Alcatraz general prison population (in December 1942), Young murdered fellow escapee McCain; no apparent motive was ever disclosed.  Young's subsequent trial featured a spirited, creative defense that put Alcatraz and the penal system on trial, leading to questions about how the prison was run.  Young was transferred from Alcatraz to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, in 1948, and then to Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla on completion of his federal sentence, to begin a life sentence for the 1933 murder conviction.\n\nRussell Gibson\nRussell \"Slim Gray\" Gibson (died January 8, 1935) was an American bank robber and Depression-era outlaw associated with Alvin Karpis and the Barker Gang during the late 1920s and 1930s.

The five men made it to the water's edge and began to look for driftwood to build a raft.  In the meantime, their absence was discovered and guards swarmed the island with rifles and machine guns.  Dark figures were spotted on the western shore and guards opened fire.  Stamphill was shot in the legs multiple times but recovered.  Doc Barker took a slug in the head and died several hours later.  The remaining three inmates gave up immediately and were recaptured without injury.  The beach was later named after Doc Barker by the National Park Service.\n\nRufus McCain\nRufus Roy McCain (July 7, 1903 – December 3, 1940) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted escape with Henri Young and Arthur Barker in 1939.\n\nBarker Black\nBarker Black is a British luxury footwear brand specializing in bench-made shoes for men.

E. Housman, was an English classical scholar and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems \"A Shropshire Lad\".  Lyrical and almost epigrammatic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside.  Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the First World War.  Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with Shropshire itself.\n\nWhen I Was One-and-Twenty\nWhen I Was One-and-Twenty, or Poem XIII, is the informal name of an untitled poem by A. E. Housman, published in \"A Shropshire Lad\" in 1896.  It is the thirteenth in a cycle of 63 poems.  One of Housman's most familiar poems, it is untitled but often anthologised under a title taken from its first line. \" The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\" includes fourteen of its sixteen lines.  Housman's \"New York Times\" obituary mentioned the poem: \"Typical of his lyrics is the poem which has thrilled the world where English is spoken.\"  Its subject matter, \"then and now\" temporal perspective, meter, and narrative structure within each verse parallel those of William Butler Yeats' \"Down by the Salley Gardens\", itself a reworking of \"The Rambling Boys of Pleasure\".\n\nJaroslav Seifert\nJaroslav Seifert (] ; 23 September 1901 – 10 January 1986) was a Nobel Prize–winning Czechoslovak writer, poet and journalist.\n\nLudvík Kundera\nLudvík Kundera (22 March 1920 – 17 August 2010) was a Czech writer, translator, poet, playwright, editor and literary historian.

{"context": "Georgia v. McCollum\nGeorgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992) was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a criminal \"defendant\" cannot make peremptory challenges based solely on race.  The court had previously held in \"Batson v. Kentucky\" (1986) that prosecutors cannot make peremptory challenges based on race, but didn't address whether defendants could use them.  The court had already ruled in \"Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company\" (1991) that the \"Batson\" prohibition also applies to civil litigants because they are state actors during the jury selection process.\n\nJ.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.\nJ. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.  T. B., 511 U.S. 127 (1994), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that making peremptory challenges based solely on a prospective juror's sex is unconstitutional.  \"J.E.B.\" extended the court's existing precedent in \"Batson v. Kentucky\" (1986), which found race-based peremptory challenges in criminal trials unconstitutional, and \"Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company\" (1991), which extended that principle to civil trials.  As in \"Batson\", the court found that sex-based challenges violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nLee v. Weisman\nLee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992) was a United States Supreme Court decision regarding school prayer.  It was the first major school prayer case decided by the Rehnquist Court.  It ruled that schools may not sponsor clerics to conduct even non-denominational prayer.  The Court followed a broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause that had been standard for decades at the nation's highest court, a reaffirmation of the principles of such landmark cases as \"Engel v. Vitale\", 370 U.S. 421 (1962) and \"Abington v. Schempp\", 374 U.S. 203 (1963) .\n\nGeorgia v. Brailsford (1793)\nGeorgia v. Brailsford, 2 U.S. 415 (1793) , was a United States Supreme Court case continuing the case of \"Georgia v. Brailsford\" (1792).  Here, the court held that \"upon a motion to dissolve that injunction, this court held that, if the state of Georgia had the title in the debt, (upon which no opinion was then expressed,) she had an adequate remedy at law by action upon the bond; but, in order that the money might be kept for the party to whom it belonged, ordered the injunction to be continued till the next term, and, if Georgia should not then have instituted her action at common law, to be dissolved.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the constitutionality of several Pennsylvania state statutory provisions regarding abortion was challenged.  The Court's plurality opinion reaffirmed the central holding of \"Roe v. Wade\" stating that \"matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  The Court's plurality opinion upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion while altering the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the \"undue burden\" standard for abortion restrictions.  \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" differs from \"Roe,\" however, because under \"Roe\" the state could not regulate abortions in the first trimester whereas under \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" the state can regulate abortions in the first trimester, or any point before the point of viability, and beyond as long as that regulation does not pose an undue burden on women's fundamental right to an abortion.  Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four regulations and invalidated the requirement of spousal notification.\n\nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul\nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992) is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down St. Paul, Minnesota's Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance and reversed the conviction of a teenager, referred to in court documents only as R.A.V., for burning a cross on the lawn of an African American family for violating the First Amendment's protections for freedom of expression.\n\nBatson v. Kentucky\nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) , was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenge in a criminal case—the dismissal of jurors without stating a valid cause for doing so—may not be used to exclude jurors based solely on their race.  The Court ruled that this practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The case gave rise to the term \"Batson challenge\", an objection to a peremptory challenge based on the standard established by the Supreme Court's decision in this case.  Subsequent jurisprudence has resulted in the extension of \"Batson\" to civil cases (\"Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company\") and cases where jurors are excluded on the basis of sex (\"J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel.  T.B.\").\n\nEdmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.\nEdmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company, 500 U.S. 614 (1991) , was a United States Supreme Court case which held that peremptory challenges may not be used to exclude jurors on the basis of race in civil trials.  \"Edmonson\" extended the court's similar decision in \"Batson v. Kentucky\" (1986), a criminal case.  The Court applied the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as determined in \"Bolling v. Sharpe\" (1954), in finding that such race-based challenges violated the Constitution.\n\nForsyth County v. Nationalist Movement\nForsyth County, Georgia v.  The Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123 (1992) was a case in which the United States Supreme Court limited the ability of local governments to charge fees for the use of public places for private activities.  By 5-4, the court ruled that an ordinance allowing the local government to set varying fees for different events violated the First Amendment due to the lack of \"narrowly drawn, reasonable, and definite standards\" governing the amount of the fee.\n\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft\nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461 (2003) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court found that a three-judge federal district court panel did not consider all of the requisite relevant factors when it examined whether the 2001 Georgia State Senate redistricting plan resulted in retrogression of black voters’ effective exercise of the electoral franchise in contravention of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  Section 5, which only applies to those states or political subdivisions that are considered “covered” under Section 4(b) of the VRA, requires that before any change in voting procedure can take effect, it must be precleared by the federal government by a demonstration that the change would not \"lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.”  The Court held that the district court analysis was incorrect “because it focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group to elect a candidate of its choice in the [safe] districts,” without giving proper consideration to other factors such as the state’s creation of additional influence and coalition districts.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case to the district court to examine the facts using the new standard announced in its opinion.\n\n"}

Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups.  The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama.  The word \"Seminole\" is derived from the Creek word \"simanó-li\", which may be itself be derived from the Spanish word \"cimarrón\", menaning \"runaway\" or \"wild one\".\n\nPresidency of Warren G.

He saw his tribe through termination, restoration, and a rebirth of Native Pride.  He was a polarizing leader, seen by some as a semi-dictator who held onto the office of principal chief and used his power to advocate for complete assimilation into the dominant society, suppressing Choctaw traditions, language and ceremonial practices as undesirable remnants of an unrefined history.

The Hammer Motor Company was formed as part of the Hammer-Sommer when they became defunct in 1905.\n\nMultimode manual transmission\nMultimode Manual Transmission (MMT or M/M, also Multimode Transmission) is a type of sequential manual transmission offered by Toyota.  It uses a traditional manual gearbox with an electronically controlled clutch.  Multimode Manual Transmission is available in the Aygo, Yaris, Corolla, Corolla Verso, Mark X and Auris in Europe, and should not be confused with Multimode Automatic Transmission, which is offered in the North American market by Toyota.\n\nSemi-automatic transmission\nA semi-automatic transmission (SAT) (also known as a clutchless manual transmission, automated manual transmission, trigger shift, flappy-paddle gear shift, or paddle-shift gearbox) is an automobile transmission that does not change gears automatically, but rather facilitates manual gear changes by dispensing with the need to press a clutch pedal at the same time as changing gears.  It uses electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators to execute gear shifts on input from the driver or by a computer.  This removes the need for a clutch pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronise the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts.  The system was designed by automobile manufacturers to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways.  Some motorcycles also use a system with a conventional gearchange but without the need for manual clutch operation.\n\nVacamatic\nThe 1941 M4 Vacamatic transmission by Chrysler was, historically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer.  It was an attempt to compete against rivals' automatic transmissions, though it still had a clutch, primarily to change range.  In normal driving, the clutch is not used.  The transmission itself was a fully synchronised manual type, with four forward gears, one reverse; where the shifting was done 'automatically' by either vacuum cylinders (early, M4), or hydraulic cylinders (late, M6, Presto-Matic).  The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between engine and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nAutomatic manual transmission\nAutomatic Manual Transmission (AMT) is a type of automatic sequential manual transmission.  Offered by Renault Group's Dacia under the Easy-R name it is founded on electro-mechanical rather than hydraulic technology.  Easy-R automated transmission uses a traditional manual gearbox with an electronically controlled clutch and eliminates the need for a clutch pedal.\n\nGM Roto Hydramatic transmission\nRoto Hydramatic (sometimes spelled Roto Hydra-Matic or Roto-Hydramatic) was an automatic transmission built by General Motors and used on some Oldsmobile and Pontiac and Holden models from 1961–1965.  It was based on the earlier, four-speed Hydramatic, but was more compact, providing only three forward speeds plus a small 8\" fluid coupling with a stator inside of the fluid coupling.  Oldsmobile, one of the users of this transmission, called the fluid couplings stator the \"Accel-A-Rotor.\"  The lightweight, aluminum-cased transmission was sometimes nicknamed the \"Slim Jim.\"  HydraMatic Division calls the Roto a four range, three gear HydraMatic.  It counts the stator multiplication @ 3.50 to one as a first gear, and when road speed and the two coupling halves speed match, it counts the same gear with fluid now passing straight through the stator as 2nd gear at 2.93 to one.  Second gear (or third range) has a ratio of 1.56 and because the fluid coupling is drained for this gear ratio making the front clutch apply makes this a rare automatic that is in FULL mechanical lock-up (coupling drained) in second gear.  Fourth range the coupling fills releasing the front clutch makes a ratio of 1 to 1.  This transmission, like single and dual range, and dual coupling hydramatics also have the feature of split torque in the transmission whereby in fourth or high gear only 40-to 50% depending on transmission, 40% in Roto's case, but because of the design the coupling is only required to carry 40% of the engine torque.  The rest is (60%) is in full mechanical connection making these hydramatics the most efficient automatic until the wide spread use of the lock-up torque converter.\n\nElectrohydraulic manual transmission\nElectrohydraulic manual transmission is a type of semi-automatic transmission system, which uses an automated clutch unlike conventional manual transmissions where the driver operates the clutch.  The clutch is controlled by electronic computers and hydraulics.  To change gears, the driver selects the desired gear with the transmission shift lever, and the system automatically operates the clutch and throttle to match revs and engage the clutch again.  Also, many such transmissions operate in sequential mode where the driver can only upshift or downshift by one gear at a time.\n\nManual transmission\nA manual transmission, also known as a manual gearbox, stick shift, \"n\"-speed manual (where \"n\" is its number of forward gear ratios), standard, MT, or in colloquial U.S. English, a stick (for vehicles with hand-lever shifters), is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications.  It uses a driver-operated clutch engaged and disengaged by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).\n\nGM 6L80 transmission\nThe 6L80 (and similar 6L90) is a six-speed automatic transmission built by General Motors at its Willow Run Transmission plant in Ypsilanti, MI.  It was introduced in late 2005, and is very similar in design to the smaller 6L45/6L50, produced at GM Powertrain in Strasbourg, France.  It features clutch to clutch shifting, eliminating the one-way clutches used on older transmission designs.  In February 2006 GM announced that it would invest $500 million to expand the Toledo Transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio to produce the 6L80 in 2008.\n\n"}
{"context": "Randy Johnson\nRandall David Johnson (born September 10, 1963), nicknamed \"The Big Unit\", is an American former baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1988 to 2009 for six teams.  He played primarily for the Seattle Mariners and the Arizona Diamondbacks.  His 303 career victories rank as the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his 4,875 strikeouts place him second all-time behind Nolan Ryan and are the most by a left-hander.  He holds five of the seven highest single-season strikeout totals by a left-hander in modern history.  Johnson won the Cy Young Award five times, second only to Roger Clemens' seven, and he is one of two pitchers (the other being Greg Maddux) to win the award four consecutive times (1999–2002).  In 1999, he joined Pedro Martínez and Gaylord Perry in the rare feat of winning the award in both the American and National Leagues.  He is also one of five pitchers to pitch no-hitters in both leagues.  On May 18, 2004, at the age of forty, Johnson became the oldest pitcher in major league history to throw a perfect game.  He is also one of eighteen pitchers in history to record a win against all 30 MLB franchises.\n\n1995 World Series\nThe 1995 World Series was the 91st edition of Major League Baseball's championship series, a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians.  The Braves won in six games to capture their third World Series championship in franchise history (along with 1914 in Boston and 1957 in Milwaukee), making them the first team to win three crowns in three different cities.  This was also Cleveland's first Series appearance in 41 years and marked the resumption of the Fall Classic after the previous year's Series was canceled due to a players' strike.\n\nJohn Smoltz\nJohn Andrew Smoltz (born May 15, 1967), nicknamed \"Smoltzie\" and \"Marmaduke,\" is an American former baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1988 to 2009, all but the last year with the Atlanta Braves.  An eight-time All-Star, Smoltz was part of a celebrated trio of starting pitchers, along with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the 1995 World Series.  He won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award in 1996 after posting a record of 24–8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972.  Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a reliever in 2001 after his recovery from Tommy John surgery, and spent four years as the team's closer before returning to a starting role.  In 2002, he set the NL record with 55 saves and became only the second pitcher in history (joining Dennis Eckersley) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season.  He is the only pitcher in major league history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves.\n\nGreg Maddux\nGregory Alan Maddux (born April 14, 1966), nicknamed \"Mad Dog\" and \"The Professor\", is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher.  Maddux is best known for his accomplishments while playing for the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs .  With the Braves, he won the 1995 World Series over the Cleveland Indians.  The first to achieve a number of feats and records, he was the first pitcher in major league history to win the Cy Young Award for four consecutive years (1992–1995), matched by only one other pitcher, Randy Johnson.  During those four seasons, Maddux had a 75–29 record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA), while allowing less than one baserunner per inning.\n\nTim Flannery (baseball)\nTimothy Earl Flannery (born September 29, 1957) is a former Major League Baseball player who spent eleven seasons with the San Diego Padres, from 1979 to 1989 .  He was the 3rd base coach of the San Francisco Giants from 2007–2014.  He is also the nephew of former Major League Baseball player Hal Smith.\n\nRubén Amaro Jr.\nRubén Amaro Jr. (born February 12, 1965) is an American former professional baseball player and General Manager who is the first base coach of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball, as of the 2016 season.  It is his first coaching job.  He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from 1991 to 1998.  Amaro was named the General Manager of the Philadelphia Phillies on November 3, 2008, succeeding Pat Gillick and remained in that position until September 10, 2015.  He is the son of the late former Major League Baseball player Rubén Amaro Sr.\n\nMike Martin (catcher)\nJoseph Michael Martin (born December 3, 1958) is a former Major League Baseball catcher.  He played eight games for the Chicago Cubs in , getting just one hit, a double in 13 at bats.  He holds the distinction of catching the final out of Greg Maddux's first win, a complete game victory over Cincinnati on September 7, having initially entered the game as a pinch-runner for Jody Davis.  1986 was Martin's last professional season after nine years in minor league baseball.\n\nEddie Pérez (baseball)\nEduardo Rafael Pérez (born May 4, 1968) is a Venezuelan-American former professional baseball player and current First Base coach.  He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers.  He batted and threw right-handed.  Pérez is the current bullpen coach for the Atlanta Braves.  He was known for being pitcher Greg Maddux's personal catcher during his tenure as a player with the Braves.\n\nList of pre-World Series baseball champions\nThe World Series, the modern championship series of Major League Baseball, began in 1903, and was established as an annual event in 1905.  Before the formation of the American Association (AA), there were no playoff rounds—all championships went to the team with the best record at the end of the season.  In the initial season of the National League (NL) in 1876, there was controversy as to which team was the champion: the Chicago White Stockings, who had the best overall record (52–14), or the St. Louis Brown Stockings (45–19), who were the only team to have a winning record against every other franchise in the league.  The teams agreed to play a five-game \"Championship of the West\" series, won by St. Louis, 4 games to 1.  Beginning in 1884, the championship series between the National League and the American Association were promoted and referred to as the \"World's Championship Series\" (WCS), or \"World's Series\" for short; however, they are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball as part of World Series history.  Though early publications, such as Ernest Lanigan's \"Baseball Cyclopedia\" and Turkin and Thompson's \"Encyclopedia of Baseball\", listed the 19th-century games on an equal basis with those of the 20th century, \"Sporting News\" publications about the World Series, which began in the 1920s, ignored the 19th-century games, as did most publications about the Series after 1960.  Major League Baseball, in general, regards 19th-century events as a prologue to the modern era of baseball, which is defined by the emergence of the two present major leagues.\n\nBig Three (Atlanta Braves)\nThe Big Three was a trio of Major League Baseball starting pitchers for the Atlanta Braves from 1993-2002.  It consisted of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz.  The Big Three was one of the best trio of pitchers in Major League Baseball.  They combined to win six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s and helped lead the Atlanta Braves to a 1995 World Series win.  Each member of the Big Three has had their jersey retired by the Atlanta Braves and has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

He is notable as the last provisional prime minister of the German-controlled puppet state of Regency Kingdom before Poland regained her independence in 1918.\n\nManchukuo\nManchukuo (: \"Mǎnzhōuguó\"literally: \" State of Manchuria\" ) was a puppet state in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, which was governed under a form of constitutional monarchy.  The area, collectively known as Manchuria by westerners and Japanese, was designated by China's erstwhile Qing Dynasty as the \"homeland\" of the ruling family's ethnic group, the Manchus.  In 1931, the region was seized by Japan following the Mukden Incident and a pro-Japanese government was installed one year later with Puyi, the last Qing emperor, as the nominal regent and emperor.  Manchukuo's government was abolished in 1945 after the defeat of Imperial Japan at the end of World War II.  The territories formally claimed by the puppet state were first seized in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, and then formally transferred to Chinese administration in the following year.\n\nFushun War Criminals Management Centre\nFushun War Criminals Management Centre (), also known as Liaodong No. 3 Prison or Liaoning No. 3 Prison, was the site of the re-education of Manchukuo, Kuomintang and Japanese prisoners of war, held by China from 1950 onwards.  It was located in the Xinfu District, Fushun, Liaoning.  Among the inmates were Puyi, the last emperor of China and former puppet emperor of Manchukuo, his younger brother Pujie and several other important World War II figures such as Xi Qia, Zang Shiyi and Zhang Jinghui.  Part of the prison site remains in use, but the older section has been turned into a museum depicting the history of Fushun war criminals management centre and the life of the people who worked or were interned there.\n\nPrime Minister's Official Spokesperson\nThe Prime Minister's Official Spokesperson or alternatively Prime Minister's Official Spokesman/Spokeswoman is a position in the United Kingdom's Civil Service, located in the Prime Minister's Office in 10 Downing Street and used by the British Prime Minister to convey information to the public.

{"context": "Public-private partnerships in Canada\nPublic-private partnerships in Canada, (PPP or P3) is a form of alternative service delivery (ASD) that involves a formal collaborative arrangement between the public and private sector in several initiatives.  This process can be done by pooling resources together to meet a common goal, or simply having the private sector focusing on carrying out specific societal responsibilities.  There are several subcategories that P3s can be grouped into.  The forms of P3s in Canada include: build–operate–transfer (BOOT), company-owned-government-operated (COGO), and government-owned-company-operated (GOCO). Public–private partnerships are commonly known for being used for infrastructure projects.  The history of P3 projects in Canada can be understood in two waves: the first wave (1990–2000) and the second wave (2000–present).  Since its Canadian origins, over 220 projects have been facilitated.  The first and most commonly known examples of P3 projects are Highway 407 in Ontario, The Royal Ottawa Hospital, and the Confederation Bridge linking New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\n\nBotroseya Church bombing\nOn 11 December 2016, a suicide bomber killed 29 people and injured 47 others at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church (commonly known as El-Botroseya Church), a chapel next to Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, in Cairo's Abbasia district.  Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, on Monday identified the bomber as 22-year-old Mahmoud Shafiq Mohammed Mustafa, who had worn a suicide vest.  el-Sisi reported that three men and a woman have been arrested in connection with the attack; two others are being sought.  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.  This was the first time the church was ever bombed.\n\nAchmad Yani International Airport\nAchmad Yani International Airport (Indonesian: \"Bandar Udara Internasional Achmad Yani\" ) (IATA: SRG, ICAO: WAHS, previously WARS, previously WIIS) serves Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia.  It used to be a military airbase owned by the TNI (Armed Forces of Indonesia) until 1966 when the airport was declared open for domestic commercial flights, other than as an airbase for the Indonesian Army.  The airport is in the coastal area of Maron beach in West Semarang district, which is prone to flooding and abrasion.  There are ponds around the compound, and mangroves will be planted along the coastline in line with the green airport concept which was scheduled to be completed by June 2013.  The area is commonly known as Kalibanteng, hence it was commonly known as Kalibanteng Airbase in the past.  The name Achmad Yani was taken to honour one of Indonesia's national heroes, General Achmad Yani.\n\nGranai airstrike\nThe Granai airstrike, sometimes called the Granai massacre, refers to the killing of approximately 86 to 147 Afghan civilians by an airstrike by a US Air Force B-1 Bomber on May 4, 2009, in the village of Granai (sometimes spelled Garani or Gerani) in Farah Province, south of Herat, Afghanistan.\n\nShannon (unit)\nThe shannon (symbol: Sh), more commonly known as the \"bit\", is a unit of information and of entropy defined by IEC 80000-13.  One shannon is the information content of an event occurring when its probability is one half.  It is also the entropy of a system with two equiprobable states.  If a message is made of a sequence of bits, with all possible bit strings being equally likely, the message's information content expressed in shannons is equal to the number of bits in the sequence.  For this and historical reasons, the shannon is more commonly known as the bit.  The introduction of the \"shannon\" term provides an explicit distinction between the amount of information that is expressed and the quantity of data that may be used to represent the information.\n\nCaptain Miller\nVallipuram Vasanthan (Tamil: வல்லிப்புரம் வசந்தன் ; 1 January 1966 – 5 July 1987; commonly known by the nom de guerre Captain Miller) was a Sri Lankan Tamil rebel and member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist Tamil militant organisation in Sri Lanka.

The German libretto was by Joseph Gregor.  The opera is based loosely on the mythological figure Daphne from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and includes elements taken from \"The Bacchae\" by Euripides.  The opera premiered at the Semperoper in Dresden on 15 October 1938, originally intended as a double bill with Strauss' \"Friedenstag\", but as the scale of \"Daphne\" grew, that idea was abandoned.  The conductor of the first performance was Karl Böhm, to whom the opera was dedicated.\n\nAging of wine\nThe aging of wine (American English) or ageing of wine (British English) is potentially able to improve the quality of wine.  This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods.  While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating, complex chemical reactions involving a wine's sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (such as tannins) can alter the aroma, color, mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster.  The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety, vintage, viticultural practices, wine region and winemaking style.  The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment.  The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle-by-bottle, depending on the conditions under which it was stored, and the condition of the bottle and cork, and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages, there are good old bottles.  There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine, as its chemistry was not understood for a long time, and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices.  However, the vast majority of wine is not aged, and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long; it is estimated that 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production, and 99% of wine within 5 years.\n\nBullet Train for Australia\nBullet Train for Australia was an Australian political party, registered from 2013 to 2017.

It was the last opera he composed.  The libretto was written by the composer's brother Modest Tchaikovsky, and is based on the Danish play \"Kong Renés Datter \" (\"King René's Daughter\") by Henrik Hertz, a romanticised account of the life of Yolande de Bar.  In the original Danish play, the spelling of the princess's name was \"Iolanthe\", later adopted for the otherwise unrelated Gilbert and Sullivan operetta of that name.  The play was translated by Fyodor Miller and adapted by Vladimir Zotov.

Instruction is provided by faculty from across all graduate divisions and schools for its 5,100 students, but the College retains a select group of young, proprietary scholars who teach its core curriculum offerings.  Unlike many major American research universities, the College is small in comparison to the University's graduate divisions, with graduate students outnumbering undergraduates at a 2:1 ratio.  The College is most notable for its core curriculum pioneered by Robert Maynard Hutchins, which remains among the most expansive of highly ranked American colleges, as well as its emphasis on preparing students for continued graduate study since 85% of graduates go onto graduate study within 5 years of graduation, which is higher than any other school, and around 15-20% of graduates go on to receive PhDs.\n\nFusepoint Managed Services\nFusepoint Managed Services was a provider of managed IT solutions for companies throughout North America, that was acquired by Savvis, Inc in 2010 .

{"context": "Plain-breasted ground dove\nThe plain-breasted ground dove (\"Columbina minuta\") is a species of bird in the family Columbidae.  They lack the scaled appearance to the feathers of the similar and typically more abundant common ground dove.  With a total length of approximately 14–16 cm (5.5-6.3 in) and a weight of 24 - , this species averages slightly smaller than the common ground dove.  The plain-breasted ground dove may be the smallest pigeons or doves by mass, though the more heavily built but almost tailess dwarf fruit dove of Southeast Asia is typically shorter in overall length.\n\nTongan ground dove\nThe Tongan ground dove (\"Alopecoenas stairi\"), also known as the shy ground dove, is a species of bird in the family Columbidae.  The species was formerly known also as the friendly ground dove.\n\nWhite-breasted ground dove\nThe white-breasted ground dove, white-bibbed ground dove, or purple ground dove (\"Alopecoenas jobiensis\"), is a species of bird in the family Columbidae.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.\n\nBabyrousa bolabatuensis\nThe Bola Batu babirusa (\"Babyrousa bolabatuensis\") is a proposed species of babirusa from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.  It was first described in 1950 as a subspecies of \"Babyrousa babyrussa\", then the only recognized species of babirusa, and raised to species rank by Colin Groves and Erik Meijaard in 2002.  At present the Bola Batu babirusa is only known for certain from subfossil remains from the southern arm of Sulawesi.  Based on a single skull from central Sulawesi it has been suggested that babirusas from this part of Sulawesi represent an extant population of the Bola Batu babirusa, and this was followed in the third edition of \"Mammal Species of the World\".  However, the most recent major review also found similarities between the central Sulawesi specimen and the Togian babirusa, leading them to conclude that it represents an undescribed taxon and that the taxonomic position of central Sulawesi babirusas only can be determined through additional specimens.  Subfossil remains from the south-western arm of Sulawesi, where now likely extinct, have been classified as Bola Batu babirusas, but these were considered unclassifiable in 2002, as were extant populations from the eastern arm of Sulawesi and Buton due to the lack of specimens.  Due to these uncertainties, the IUCN Red List provisionally synonymized \"B. bolabatuensis\" under the northern Sulawesi species, \"B. celebensis\", pending clarification of the taxonomy of Sulawesi babirusas.\n\nHenderson archaic pigeon\nThe Henderson archaic pigeon (\"Bountyphaps obsoleta\"), or Henderson Island archaic pigeon, is an extinct bird in the Columbidae, or pigeon family.

They include both living and extinct species, although the term more frequently refers to the extinct giant lemurs.  The diversity of subfossil lemur communities was greater than that of present-day lemur communities, ranging from as high as 20 or more species per location, compared with 10 to 12 species today.  Extinct species are estimated to have ranged in size from slightly over 10 kg to roughly 160 kg .  Even the subfossil remains of living species are larger and more robust than the skeletal remains of modern specimens.  The subfossil sites found around most of the island demonstrate that most giant lemurs had wide distributions and that ranges of living species have contracted significantly since the arrival of humans.\n\n"}
{"context": "Congreve clock\nA Congreve clock (also known as Congreve's Rolling Ball Clock or Oscillating Path Rolling Ball Clock) is a type of clock that uses a ball rolling along a zig-zag track rather than a pendulum to regulate the time.  It was invented by Sir William Congreve in 1808.  The ball takes between 15 seconds and one minute to run down the zig-zag track, where it trips the escapement which in turn reverses the tilt of the tray and at the same time causes the hands of the clock to move forward.  Thus the angle of the plate reverses and the clock hands move forward between one and four times every minute.  On versions of the clock with a dial to indicate seconds, the second hand jumps forward either 15 or 30 seconds on each oscillation depending on the length of the track.\n\n30 Seconds to Mars (album)\n30 Seconds to Mars is the debut studio album by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars.

{"context": "William Vennard\nWilliam Vennard (31 January 1909 Normal, Illinois – 10 January 1971 Los Angeles, California) was a famous American vocal pedagogist who devoted his life to researching the human voice and its use in singing.  He was one of the driving forces behind a major shift within the field of vocal pedagogy during the middle of the 20th century.  Along with a few other American singing teachers, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University, Vennard introduced contemporary scientific research in the areas of human anatomy and physiology into the study of singing.  This shift in approach led to the rejection of many of the beliefs and practices held since the bel canto era, most particularly in the areas of vocal registration and vocal resonation.  Vennard was renowned as an excellent teacher whose written works have influenced generations of singers, vocal pedagogues and voice scientists.  He taught many successful singers including acclaimed mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who studied under him at the University of Southern California.\n\nVocal fry register\nThe vocal fry register (also known as pulse register, laryngealization, pulse phonation, creak, croak, popcorning, glottal fry, glottal rattle, glottal scrape, or strohbass) is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through slowly with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency.  During this phonation, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx are drawn together which causes the vocal folds to compress rather tightly and become relatively slack and compact.  This process forms a large and irregularly vibrating mass within the vocal folds that produces the characteristic low popping or rattling sound when air passes through the glottal closure.  The register (if well controlled) can extend far below the modal voice register, in some cases up to 8 octaves lower, such as in the case of Tim Storms who holds the world record for lowest frequency note ever produced by a human, a G−7, which is only 0.189 Hz.  Humans however can only hear sounds down to 12 Hz under ideal conditions.\n\nRay Smolover\nItzchok Reev \"Ray\" Smolover (January 15, 1921 – September 11, 2015) was an American vocal pedagogist, voice teacher, tenor, opera librettist, opera director, and hazzan.  He was a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University and Columbia University.  One of his notable students was Richard Kiley.  He is the author of several publications on the art of singing, including \"The Singer’s Handbook\", \"Vocal Behavior Analysis and Modification\", and \"Sing Your Best\".\n\nVoice type\nA voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\"passaggio\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice.  Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register.  A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type.  The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing.  Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices.  Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \"Fach\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.\n\nHuman voice\nThe human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal folds for talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, etc.  The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source.  (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.)  Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx, and the articulators.  The lung (the pump) must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds (this air pressure is the fuel of the voice).  The vocal folds (vocal cords) are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs into audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.  The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to ‘fine-tune’ pitch and tone.  The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.\n\nCoup de glotte\nCoup de glotte or 'shock of the glottis' is a term used in the theory of singing technique to describe a particular method of emitting or opening a note by an abrupt physical mechanism of the glottis (the space between the vocal folds).  During the 19th century there was disagreement among teachers and performers as to whether the technique should be taught as a normal part of vocal method or not.  The technique is still sometimes used to achieve particular effects, dramatic or ornamental, but is usually avoided in the teaching of fundamental vocal method.  In English, it is often called a glottal attack.\n\nVocal register\nA vocal register is a range of tones in the human voice produced by a particular vibratory pattern of the vocal folds.  These registers include modal voice (or normal voice), vocal fry, falsetto, and the whistle register.\n\nElectroglottograph\nThe electroglottograph, or EGG, (also referred to as a laryngograph) is a device used for the noninvasive measurement of the degree of contact between the vibrating vocal folds during voice production.  Though it is difficult to verify the assumption precisely, the aspect of contact being measured by a typical EGG unit is considered to be the vocal fold contact area (VFCA).  To measure VFCA, an electrodes are applied on the surface of the neck so that the EGG records variations in the transverse electrical impedance of the larynx and nearby tissues by means of a small A/C electric current (in megaHertz).  This electrical impedance will vary slightly with the area of contact between the moist vocal folds during the setment of the glottal vibratory cycle in which the folds are in contact.  However, because the percentage variation in the neck impedance caused by vocal fold contact can be extremely small and varies considerably between subjects, no absolute measure of contact area is obtained, only the pattern of variation for a given subject.\n\nFaucalized voice\nFaucalized voice, also called hollow voice or yawny voice, is a vocal quality of speech production characterized by the vertical expansion of the pharyngeal cavity due to the lowering of the larynx.  It is termed \"faucalized\" because of the stretching of the fauces and visible narrowing of the faucial pillars in the back of the oral cavity.  During faucalized voice, the sides of pharynx expand outward and the larynx descends and tilts forward.  The term \"yawny voice\" is appropriate to compare this voice quality to the physiological act of yawning.  Its opposite is \"harsh voice\", a vocal quality produced when the pharynx is contracted and the larynx raised.  Faucalized voice is not to be confused with \"breathy voice\", which involves relaxed vocal folds, greater velocity of airflow through the glottis and produces a lower pitch sound.  Faucalized voice involves the forward tilting of the larynx which stretches the vocal folds and produces a higher pitch sound, despite the increased volume of the pharyngeal cavity.\n\nVocal fold nodule\nVocal fold nodules are bilaterally symmetrical benign white masses that form at the midpoint of the vocal folds.  Although diagnosis involves a physical examination of the head and neck, as well as perceptual voice measures, visualization of the vocal nodules via laryngeal endoscopy remains the primary diagnostic method.  Vocal fold nodules interfere with the vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds by increasing the mass of the vocal folds and changing the configuration of the vocal fold closure pattern.  Due to these changes, the quality of the voice may be affected.  As such, the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules include vocal hoarseness and breathiness.  Other common symptoms include vocal fatigue, soreness or pain lateral to the larynx, and reduced frequency and intensity range.  Airflow levels during speech may also be increased.  Vocal fold nodules are thought to be the result of vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress, including repeated or chronic vocal overuse, abuse, or misuse.  Predisposing factors include profession, gender, dehydration, respiratory infection, and other inflammatory factors.\n\n"}

Around this time, the band also recorded a song called \"Shot in the Dark\" that was never featured on an album.  However, this tune later served as the prototype for Ozzy Osbourne's song of the same name.  Wildlife's version was never officially released, and the band split up soon after.\n\nGabrielle Aplin discography\nThe discography of British singer-songwriter Gabrielle Aplin, consists of two studio albums, four extended plays, three live albums and five singles.

{"context": "Illinois and Michigan Canal\nThe Illinois and Michigan Canal connected the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.  In Illinois, it ran 96 mi from the Chicago River in Bridgeport, Chicago to the Illinois River at LaSalle-Peru.  The canal crossed the Chicago Portage and helped establish Chicago as the transportation hub of the United States, before the railroad era.  It was opened in 1848, its function was largely replaced by the wider and shorter Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in 1900 and it ceased transportation operations with the completion of the Illinois Waterway in 1933.\n\nNorth Shore Channel\nThe North Shore Channel is a drainage canal built between 1907 and 1910 to flush the sewage-filled North Branch of the Chicago River down the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.  The sewage carrying duty has been largely taken over by the Chicago Deep Tunnel, but there are still occasional discharges due to heavy rains.\n\nThe Volunteer (canal boat)\nThe Volunteer is a 76-foot replica of a 19th-century canal boat which is owned and operated by the Canal Corridor Association.  \"The Volunteer\" operates on a restored section of the Illinois and Michigan Canal at LaSalle, Illinois, US.\n\nEvanston Wilmette Community Golf Course\nThe Evanston Wilmette Community Golf Course, formerly known as the Peter N. Jans Memorial Golf Course and locally called the Canal Shores Golf Course, is an 18-hole, par 60 golf course located in a suburban residential neighborhood on the east side of Evanston and Wilmette, Illinois.  Founded in 1919 on the banks of the North Shore Channel of the Chicago River, the course is 3,904 yards in length, featuring a narrow and tree-lined fairway and two over-the-water holes.  Eleven of the holes are located in Evanston, Illinois and 7 holes are in Wilmette, Illinois.\n\nMorris Wide Water Canal Boat Site\nThe Morris Wide Water Canal Boat Site is an archaeological site in Morris, Illinois, which contains the remains of seven canal boats sunk in the Illinois & Michigan Canal.  The boats were likely built between 1865 and 1885 and were abandoned at the site between 1895 and 1915, after which they gradually sank.  All of the boats were flat-bottomed with a rounded bow and stern.  The hulls of the boats are in good condition and provide insight into construction methods used in canal boats of the period.  As no fully intact Illinois canal boats from the period survive, the remains of these boats are some of the few pieces of physical evidence which can be used to study canal travel during the era.  The remains were first discovered in 1978 after a storm exposed the part of the canal bed containing the boats; another storm in 1996 again exposed the boats and allowed further studies to be conducted on them.\n\nIllinois River\nThe Illinois River is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 273 mi long, in the U.S. state of Illinois.  The river drains a large section of central Illinois, with a drainage basin of 28756.6 sqmi .  The drainage basin extends into Wisconsin and Indiana.  This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi.  The French colonial settlements along the river formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country.  After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was extended into the era of modern industrial shipping.  It now forms the basis for the Illinois Waterway.\n\nLadd Arboretum\nThe Edward R. Ladd Arboretum is an arboretum located at 2024 McCormick Boulevard, Evanston, Illinois, occupying 23 acres (93,000 m²) in a narrow three-quarter mile (1.2 km) stretch between McCormick Boulevard and the North Shore Channel on land leased from the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.\n\nIllinois Waterway\nThe Illinois Waterway system consists of 336 mi of water from the mouth of the Calumet River to the mouth of the Illinois River at Grafton, Illinois.  It is a system of rivers, lakes, and canals which provide a shipping connection from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.  The Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1849.  In 1900, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal replaced it and reversed the flow of the Chicago River so it no longer flowed into Lake Michigan.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains a 9 ft navigation channel in the waterway.  The waterway's complex northern section is referred to in various contexts for study and management as the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).\n\nNorth Shore (Chicago)\nThe North Shore consists of many affluent suburbs north of Chicago, Illinois, bordering the shores of Lake Michigan.  These communities fall within suburban Cook County and Lake County.  The North Shore's membership is often a topic of debate, and is sometimes expanded to include other affluent Chicago suburbs which do not border Lake Michigan.  However, Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff are generally considered to be the core members of the North Shore, as all are affluent communities that border the lake just north of Chicago.  Other suburbs such as Glenview, Northbrook, Deerfield, Highwood, Skokie, and Northfield are often considered to be a part of the North Shore, but do not border Lake Michigan.\n\nWill County Historical Society Headquarters\nThe Will County Historical Society Headquarters is a historic building in Lockport, Illinois, United States, originally known as the Illinois and Michigan Canal Office Building.

As of the 2010 census the population was 407 residents.\n\nCoal Hill Coal Railroad\nThe Coal Hill Coal Railroad began as a coal mine on the north face of Mt. Washington, then known as \"Coal Hill\", begun by Jacob Beltzhoover in 1825.  This mine was operated by a series of persons, finally by James M. Bailey, who extended the mine completely though the hill to the south side of the hill in 1861.  The mine was then sold to the Pittsburgh Coal Company, and rails from the mine were extended an additional one half mile to a new coal mine on the south side of Saw Mill Run.  The rails were extended to a third mine, for a total length of one and one half miles.  In spite of this short length, the railroad had 3 locomotives and 280 coal cars.  The narrow gauge railroad delivered coal from these mines to South Pittsburgh via an inclined plane, which ran from the northern end of the mine to Carson Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The railroad was sold by the Pittsburgh Coal Company to the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad in 1871.  After this sale, the mine was enlarged to form the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel, and the train tracks were extended to Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania.\n\nRobertsdale, Pennsylvania\nRobertsdale is an unincorporated community in Wood Township in southern Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States.  It is situated on Broad Top Mountain near the eastern slope.  It was founded in 1872 as part of the construction of the East Broad Top Railroad and Coal Company as the original terminus and mining location.  The town was created by the EBT's parent company, the Rockhill Iron and Coal Company, which operated most of the mines on the east side of the Broad Top Coal field.  The initial focus of mining was the Houk Mine (renamed Rockhill Iron and Coal Mine #1) which predated the town, though as a much smaller producer.  Later RI&C #5 became a large producer.  Mines #2, #3 and #4 were in Robertsdale but were not large producers and operated only briefly.  Later the EBT was extended to Woodvale, Alvan and new Alvan as the focus of mining moved along the coal seams, though Robertsdale remained the mining headquarters.  Robertsdale was a typical coal ming town complete with company owned miner houses, a company store, a company owned water and power system and other company owned facilities.  Coal mining and its support industries were the principal employers.\n\nMcAdams, Pennsylvania\nMcAdams (also known as Montour No. 9) is an unincorporated community in Robinson Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States.  McAdams is located at the intersection of Pennsylvania Route 980 and North Branch Road 2.2 mi west-northwest of McDonald.

It includes all or part of Allegheny, Fayette, Greene, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties in Pennsylvania.  Coal has been mined in Pittsburgh since the 18th century.  U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel owned Karen, Maple Creek, and Ellsworth mines.  It is not possible to define sharp geographical boundaries for this district for none such exist or are reported differently.  The largest company in this field was the Pittsburgh Coal Company, which later became CONSOL Energy.  It is bordered on the west by the state of West Virginia, on the south by Panhandle Coalfield and Klondike Coalfield, on the East by Irwin Gas Coalfield, on the North by the Freeport Coalfield and at least one other coalfield.  The Darr Mine Disaster occurred in this coalfield in 1907.\n\nConsol Energy\nConsol Energy Inc. is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.  In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.\n\nPittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad\nThe Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad was a narrow-gauge railroad in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.  Originally built in 1871, it may have been the first American common-carrier narrow-gauge railroad.  It purchased a rail line called the Coal Hill Coal Railroad from the Pittsburgh Coal Company, and used a coal mine under Mt. Washington as a tunnel to transport coal from Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh.  Passenger traffic was added soon afterwards, and the train carried passengers during the day and coal at night.  The original plan was to extend the line to Finleyville, Pennsylvania, but the original narrow-gauge line ran only as far as Castle Shannon.  The right of way continued as the Pittsburgh, Castle Shannon and Washington Railroad, later to become part of the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad.\n\nPittsburgh and Castle Shannon Plane\nPittsburgh and Castle Shannon Plane was a narrow gauge incline railway that ran from the northern end of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel to Carson Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Originally built to carry coal from the Jacob Beltzhoover mine, it was sold by the Pittsburgh Coal Company to the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad in 1871.  It was used only for coal as early as 1864, passenger traffic was added in 1874 for the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad.  For safety reasons, the tunnel was closed to passenger traffic, and passengers were diverted to the Castle Shannon Incline, constructed in 1890.  Emergency use of the plane for passengers and freight continued as late as 1900.  Its use for the transport of passengers and freight other than coal was made obsolete by the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel.  Operation as a coal incline continued until May 1, 1912.\n\nPittsburgh Coal Company\nThe Pittsburgh Coal Company was a bituminous coal mining company based in Pittsburgh and controlled by the Mellon family.  In 1945 it merged with Consolidation Coal Company, controlled by the Rockefeller family.\n\n"}

Groseclose\nHenry C. Groseclose was born on May 17, 1892.  He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life.  Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from Washington and Lee University in 1917.  In his later years, he also received his bachelor’s degree, as well as his master’s degree, in agricultural education from Virginia Tech.  While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he, along with three other agriculture teachers, Walter Newman, Edmund Magill and Harry Sanders, decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school.  The organization was fired up in 1925.  Groseclose named the organization the Future Farmers of Virginia, or FFV for short.  The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the First Families of Virginia.  The “first families” referred to the families of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.”  Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on.  In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting.  Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization.  This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The National FFA Organization, or just FFA for short.  The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization.  Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today.  Groseclose was a seventh degree Grange member, and he was also involved with the Masons, so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses.  These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter.  While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today.  The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half plowed wheat field with an owl perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field.  Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930.  During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization.  Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941.  In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, \"In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state.  But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority.  Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin.  This condition should not exist.  I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap.  Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership.  In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys.\"  Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4 of 1950.  In 2002, the Department of Historic Resources established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor.

The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\nHolcut, Mississippi\nHolcut was a small town located in Tishomingo County, Mississippi, United States.

It occupied the former grounds of Mount St. Vincent's Academy near 102nd St and East Drive in Central Park, just west of Fifth Avenue and atop the Revolutionary War site of McGowan's Pass.  In medical and military records it is usually referred to as the United States General Hospital, Central Park; and sometimes elsewhere as St. Joseph's Military Hospital (as it was named by Sisters of Charity, who built the complex and provided nursing staff).\n\n36th Street (BMT Fifth Avenue Line)\n36th Street was a station on the demolished section of the BMT Fifth Avenue Line.  It was served by trains of the BMT Culver Line and BMT Fifth Avenue Line.  It had four tracks and two island platforms.  The station was opened on May 29, 1890, and was the southern terminus of the Fifth Avenue Line until 1893, as well as the southernmost station to be installed along Fifth Avenue itself.  Stations built beyond this point were located along Third Avenue, and the line was sometimes called the BMT Third Avenue Line south of here.  The next stop to the north was 25th Street.  The next stop to the south was Ninth Avenue for Culver Line trains and 40th Street for Fifth Avenue Line trains.  Ninth Avenue station still exists today exclusively for the BMT West End Line.  The station closed on May 31, 1940.  Current rapid transit service in this area can be found one block west at the 36th Street Station on the underground BMT Fourth Avenue Line.\n\nCentral Park Place\nCentral Park Place is a 56-story condominium building in New York City.

It has been called \"the most pedigreed building on the snobbiest street in the country’s most real estate-obsessed city\" in an article in the New York Observer newspaper.  This status is due to the building's overall architecture, the scale and layout of the apartments, and the notoriety of its current and past residents.  It is one of the finest buildings designed by Rosario Candela, according to \"The New York Times\".\n\nGrand Army Plaza (Manhattan)\nGrand Army Plaza lies between 58th Street and 60th Street, just west of Fifth Avenue and just east of East Drive.

{"context": "USS Bainbridge (CGN-25)\nUSS \"Bainbridge\" (DLGN-25/CGN-25) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy, the only ship of her class.  Named in honor of Commodore William Bainbridge, she was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name.  With her original hull classification symbol of DLGN (nuclear-powered guided missile destroyer leader, called a \"frigate\" at the time), she was the first nuclear-powered destroyer-type ship in the US Navy, and shared her name with the lead ship of the first US Navy destroyer class, the \"Bainbridge\"-class destroyer s.\n\nTachikaze-class destroyer\nThe \"Tachikaze\"-class destroyer is a second generation guided missile destroyer class, formerly in service with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).  The ships of this class have had successive improvements after their completion, especially to their C4I systems.  These air-defense warships are the natural successor to the first generation air-defense ship, the \"Amatsukaze\"-class destroyer , and they were in turn, followed by newer air-defense ships, the \"Hatakaze\" class .\n\nMitscher-class destroyer\nThe \"Mitscher\"-class destroyer was an experimental destroyer class of four ships that were built for the United States Navy shortly after World War II.  Considerably larger than all previous destroyers, they would have been the first post-war destroyer class had they not been reclassified during construction as destroyer leaders (DL).  Commissioned in 1953-1954, two of the class served until 1969, and were scrapped in the 1970s.  The other two were converted into guided missile destroyers (DDG), served until 1978, and were sold for scrap by 1980.\n\nHMS Hampshire (D06)\nHMS \"Hampshire\" was a County-class destroyer of the Royal Navy.  Laid down, in March 1959 a couple of weeks behind the class leader \"Devonshire\" , she was classified as a guided missile destroyer, as the Sea Lords regarded the concept of the cruiser and big gun ship as discredited by the perceived failure of the \"Tiger\" class and the obsolescence of the heavy gun.  The description of guided missile destroyer seemed more likely to win approval from the Treasury and Government for an adequate number of warships the size of small cruisers, which could play many traditional cruiser flagship and command functions, but had no armour around its gun and missile magazine.\n\nUSS Mahan (DDG-42)\nUSS \"Mahan\" (DDG-42), was a \"Farragut\"-class guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy.  She was named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan USN (1840–1914).  The ship was Laid down as DLG-11 by the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 31 July 1957 and launched on 7 October 1959.  \"Mahan\" was sponsored by Mrs. H. P. Smith, wife of Vice Adm. Harold Page Smith, and commissioned on 25 December 1960.  \"Mahan\" was reclassified as a guided missile destroyer on 30 June 1975 and designated DDG-42.  USS \"Mahan\" was decommissioned on 15 June 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day.\n\nIsaac C. Kidd\nIsaac Campbell Kidd (March 26, 1884 – December 7, 1941) was an American Rear Admiral in the United States Navy.  Kidd was killed on the bridge of USS \"Arizona\" during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  He was the father of Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. He was a posthumous recipient of his nation's highest military honor—the Medal of Honor.  The highest ranking casualty at Pearl Harbor, he became the first U.S. Navy flag officer killed in action in World War II as well as the first killed in action against any foreign enemy.  A \"Fletcher\"-class destroyer , \"Kidd\" (DD-661) , was commissioned in his honor on April 23, 1943.  The second ship named after him, \"Kidd\" (DDG-993) , lead ship of four \"Kidd\"-class destroyer s, was commissioned on March 27, 1981.  An \"Arleigh Burke\"-class guided missile destroyer, \"Kidd\" (DDG-100) , was the third ship named after him and was commissioned on June 9, 2007.\n\nUSS Dahlgren (DDG-43)\nUSS \"Dahlgren\" (DLG-12/DDG-43) was the 7th ship in the \"Farragut\"-class guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy.  She was launched on 16 March 1960 by Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and sponsored by Mrs. Katharine D. Cromwell, granddaughter of Rear Admiral John Adolphus Dahlgren.  She was commissioned on 8 April 1961, Commander C. E. Landis in command.  It was the third ship in the Navy to bear the name.  Commissioned as DLG-12, \"Dahlgren\" was reclassified a guided missile destroyer on July 1, 1975 and given the new hull number DDG-43.  The ship saw service until 1992, when she was placed in reserve.  She was sold for scrapping three times, the first time in 1994, but was repossessed twice as the ship breaking companies failed.  The ship was finally dismantled in 2006.\n\nFarragut-class destroyer (1958)\nThe Farragut\"-class destroyer was a group of 10 guided missile destroyers built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1950s.  They were the second destroyer class to be named for Admiral David Farragut.  The class is sometimes referred to as the Coontz\" class, since \"Coontz\" was first to be designed and built as a guided missile ship, whereas the previous three ships were designed as all-gun units and converted later.\n\nHMS Sheffield (D80)\nHMS \"Sheffield\" was the second Royal Navy ship to be named after the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire.  She was a Type 42 guided missile destroyer laid down by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering at Barrow-in-Furness on 15 January 1970.  She was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 June 1971 and commissioned on 16 February 1975.\n\nType 42 destroyer\nThe Type 42 or \"Sheffield\" class, was a class of fourteen light guided missile destroyers that served in the Royal Navy.

{"context": "Lettuce necrotic yellows virus\nLettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV) is a plant virus belonging to the virus order \"Mononegavirales\", family \"Rhabdoviridae\" and genus \"Cytorhabdovirus\".  It was first identified in Australia in the plant species \"Lactuca sativa\" in 1963 by Stubbs et al.  Since then it has been identified in many other plant species including \"Datura stramonium\" and \"Nicotiana glutinosa\".  The virus is transmitted by the insect vector \"Hyperomyzus lactucae\" the insect can become infected by feeding on an infected plant.  It then acts as a reservoir for the virus in which it can multiply.  The virus is also transmitted congenitally to its progeny\n\nOlea hochstetteri\nOlea hochstetteri (East African olive, black ironwood) is a species of tree of the Oleaceae family, often considered a subspecies of Olea capensis.  Like the related species Olea welwitschii, it grows in sandy desert regions of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.  It is an inconspicuous plant that does not attain great height, in contrast to O. welwitschii which can attain a height of 25m.\n\nEmmenopterys\nEmmenopterys is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family.  The genus is found in China, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nHalophyte\nA halophyte is a plant that grows in waters of high salinity, coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, mangrove swamps, marshes and sloughs and seashores.  The word derives from Ancient Greek ἅλας (halas) 'salt' and φυτόν (phyton) 'plant'.  An example of a halophyte is the salt marsh grass \"Spartina alterniflora\" (smooth cordgrass).  Relatively few plant species are halophytes—perhaps only 2% of all plant species.\n\nOlea oleaster\nOlea oleaster, the wild-olive, has been considered by various botanists a valid species and a subspecies of the cultivated olive tree, \"Olea europea\", which is a tree of multiple origins that was domesticated, it now appears, at various places during the fourth and third millennia BCE, in selections drawn from varying local populations.  The wild-olive (Ancient Greek \"kotinos\"), which ancient Greeks distinguished from the cultivated olive tree (Ancient Greek ἐλάα), was used to fashion the olive wreath awarded victors at the ancient Olympic games.  The ancient and sacred wild-olive tree of Olympia stood near the Temple of Zeus, patron of the games.\n\nPlant cover\nThe abundances of plant species are often measured by plant cover, i.e. the relative area covered by different plant species in a small plot.  Plant cover is not biased by the size and distributions of individuals, and is an important and often measured characteristic of the composition of plant communities.  Plant cover data may be used to classify the studied plant community into a vegetation type, to test different ecological hypothesis on plant abundance, and in gradient studies, where the effects of different environmental gradients on the abundance of specific plant species are investigated.\n\nPlagiobothrys hirtus\nPlagiobothrys hirtus, the rough popcornflower, is a plant species with only about a dozen reportedly extant occurrences, all within the Umpqua River watershed in Douglas County, Oregon.  It is federally listed endangered in the United States of America.  In fact \"P. hirtus\" is now considered to be one of the top three most endangered vascular plant species in the Northwest.  The state of Oregon has ranked this plant as its number one recovery priority due to its high degree of threat as well as its high rating in recovery potential.  Its recovery depends on conservation of existing populations as well as reintroduction of new populations in protected and species-appropriate areas.\n\nAlseuosmia macrophylla\nAlseuosmia macrophylla, the toropapa or karapapa, is a plant species in the family Alseuosmiaceae.  This is a small evergreen shrub which is endogenous to New Zealand, along with two closely related species.  An example occurrence of \"A. macrophylla\" is in the North Island habitat of the Hamilton Ecological District, where \"Blechnum discolor\" and \"Blechnum filiforme\" are understory elements with \"Nothofagus truncata\" and rimu overstory.  This plant is known for the pleasant scent of its flowers, and its family name translates as \"perfumed grove\".  The small red berries of toropapa are edible and sweet tasting.  As a forest understory plant, toropapa will not tolerate full sunlight or frost, and needs its roots to stay moist and cool, however so long as these conditions are met it is reasonably hardy, and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant.\n\nOlea\nOlea is a genus of about 40 species in the family Oleaceae, native to warm temperate and tropical regions of southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and Australasia.  They are evergreen trees and shrubs, with small, opposite, entire leaves.  The fruit is a drupe.  Leaves of \"Olea\" contain trichosclereids.\n\nWildlife of Burkina Faso\nBurkina Faso is largely wild bush country with a mixture of grass and small trees in varying proportions.  The savanna region is mainly grassland in the rainy season and semi desert during the harmattan period (defined as the period when stormy and dusty Sahara winds blow dry and hot).  Fauna, one of the most diverse in West Africa, includes the elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, monkey, lions, crocodile, giraffe, various types of antelope, and a vast variety of bird and insect life.  The country has 147 mammal species, 330 aquatic species including 121 species of fish and 2067 different plant species.  Of the plant species, the dominant endemic species are shea tree \"(Butyrospermum parkii\") and the baobab, the former plant species has immense economic value to the country.\n\n"}

The Yarlung Tsangpo (Tibetan name for the upper course of the Brahmaputra) originates near Mount Kailash and runs east for about 1700 km, draining a northern section of the Himalayas before it enters the gorge just downstream of Pei, Tibet near the settlement of Zhibe.  The canyon has a length of about 150 miles (240 km) as the gorge bends around Mount Namcha Barwa (7782 m) and cuts its way through the eastern Himalayan range.  Its waters drop from about 2,900 m near Pei to about 1,500 m at the end of the Upper Gorge where the Po Tsangpo River enters.  The river continues through the Lower Gorge to the Indian border at an elevation of 660 m.  The river then enters Arunachal Pradesh and eventually becomes the Brahmaputra.\n\nJohn Hance\nJohn Hance (1840 – January 8, 1919) is thought to be the first non-Native American resident of the Grand Canyon, US.  He opened the first tourist trail in the canyon in the late nineteenth century.  He started giving tours of the canyon after his attempts at mining asbestos failed, largely due to the expense of removing the asbestos from the canyon.  \"Captain\" John Hance was said to be one of the Grand Canyon's most colorful characters, and it had been declared by one early visitor that \"To see the canyon only and not to see Captain John Hance, is to miss half the show.\"  Hance delighted in telling canyon stories to visitors, favoring the whopper of a tale over mere facts.  With a straight face, Hance told travelers how he had dug the canyon himself, piling the excavated earth down near Flagstaff (a dirt pile now known as the San Francisco Peaks).  Despite such questionable claims, Hance left a lasting legacy at the Grand Canyon, dying in 1919, the year the Grand Canyon became a National Park.

{"context": "Demala diviyan keliya\nDemala diviyan keliya is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon.  It is a hunt game, and since it uses a triangle board, Demala diviyan keliya is specifically a leopard hunt game (or leopard game).  Three tigers are going up against fifteen leopards.  The leopards attempt to surround and trap the tigers while the tigers attempt to capture enough of them (usually 7) so that the leopards can not immobilize the tigers.  It is unknown how old the game is, but the game was described by H. Parker in his 1909 book \"Ancient Ceylon - An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation\".  The game is also known as the Tamil leopards game.  In India, it is called Rafaya.\n\nPrehistoric Europe\nPrehistoric Europe is the designation for the period of human presence in Europe before the start of recorded history, beginning in the Lower Paleolithic.  As history progresses, considerable regional irregularities of cultural development emerge and increase.  The region of the eastern Mediterranean is, due to its geographic proximity, greatly influenced and inspired by the classical Middle Eastern civilizations, and adopts and develops the earliest systems of communal organisation and writing.  The Histories of Herodotus (from around 440 BC) is the oldest known European text that seeks to systematically record traditions, public affairs and notable events.  In contrast, the European regions furthest away from the ancient centers of civilisation tended to be the slowest, regarding acculturation.  In Northern and Eastern Europe in particular, writing and systematic recording was only introduced in the context of Christianization, after 1000 CE.\n\nHistory of Sabah\nThe history of Sabah can be traced back to about 23–30,000 years ago when evidence suggests the earliest human settlement in the region existed.  The history is interwoven with the history of Brunei and the history of Malaysia, to which Sabah was previously part of and is currently part of respectively.  The earliest recorded history of Sabah being part of any organised civilisation began in the early 15th century during the thriving era of the Sultanate of Brunei.  Prior to this, early inhabitants of the land lived in predominantly tribal societies, although such tribal societies had continued to exist until the 1900s.  The eastern part of Sabah was ceded to the Sultan of Sulu by the Sultan of Brunei in 1658 for the former helping a victory over Brunei enemies, but many sources stated it had not been ceded at all.  By the late 19th century, both territories previously owned by Sultan of Brunei and Sultan of Sulu was granted to British syndicate.  Sabah became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 and subsequently became a crown colony until 1963, during which time it was known as North Borneo.  On 16 September 1963, Sabah merged with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore (left in 1965) to form the Federation of Malaysia.\n\nAncient monuments of Java\nHundreds of ancient stone religious monuments lie on the island of Java.  Known as \"candi\" in Indonesian, they date from the early classical period of Javanese civilisation, beginning in the first part of the 8th century CE and ending after 900 CE.  The majority were built between 780 CE and 860 CE, even though the civilisation that created them existed for many centuries.\n\nStyles and themes of Robert E. Howard\nThe distinctive literary styles and themes of Robert E. Howard rely on a combination of many factors.  In his fiction, he used devices borrowed from classical and traditional works, as well as formal rhetoric.  In his poetry, he used rhythm, stress, and intonation to achieve a sense of motion.  Some of his fiction has been described as prose poetry.  His works can be distinguished by his use of violence and hate as positive forces in his universe, which can be seen as a part of the American Myth.  In keeping with the era in which he worked, a grim and hardboiled theme pervades.  The continuing cycle of civilisation and barbarism is highlighted in several works.  Although he died before it was formally defined, an existentialism subtext runs through his writing.  He was an aesthete and had affinity for romanticism and neo-romanticism, although in this he was out of step with his era.\n\nSao civilisation\nThe Sao civilisation flourished in Middle Africa from ca.  the sixth century BC to as late as the sixteenth century AD.  The Sao lived by the Chari River Around Lake Chad in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad.  They are the earliest people to have left clear traces of their presence in the territory of modern Cameroon.

{"context": "Through a Blue Lens\nThrough a Blue Lens is a documentary film produced by the National Film Board of Canada.  The film follows interactions between police officers and drug addicts and documents the extreme poverty and suffering many addicts endure.\n\nBox camera\nA box camera is a simple type of camera, the most common form being a cardboard or plastic box with a lens in one end and film at the other.  They were very popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The lenses are often single element designs meniscus fixed focus lens, or in better quality box cameras a doublet lens with minimal (if any) possible adjustments to the aperture or shutter speeds. Because of the inability to adjust focus, the small lens aperture and the low sensitivity of the sensitive materials available, these cameras work best in brightly lit day-lit scenes when the subject is within the hyperfocal distance for the lens and of subjects that move little during the exposure.  Eventually, box cameras with photographic flash, shutter and aperture adjustment were introduced, allowing indoor photos.\n\nA-scan ultrasound biometry\nA-scan ultrasound biometry, commonly referred to as an A-scan (short for Amplitude scan), is routine type of diagnostic test used in optometry or ophthalmology.  The A-scan provides data on the length of the eye, which is a major determinant in common sight disorders.  The most common use of the A-scan is to determine eye length for calculation of intraocular lens power.  Briefly, the total refractive power of the emmetropic eye is approximately 60.  Of this power, the cornea provides roughly 40 diopters, and the crystalline lens 20 diopters.  When a cataract is removed, the lens is replaced by an artificial lens implant.  By measuring both the length of the eye (A-scan) and the power of the cornea (keratometry), a simple formula can be used to calculate the power of the intraocular lens needed.  There are several different formulas that can be used depending on the actual characteristics of the eye.  All the information here is not valid for medical purposes.\n\nAnti-scratch coating\nAn anti-scratch or scratch-resistant coating is a film or coating that can be applied to optical surfaces, such as the faces of a lens or photographic film.  The coating does not interfere with how the lens functions and does not affect vision, but creates a permanent bond with the lens that reduces the appearance of hairline scratches which is common to eyeglass lenses.  Though an anti-scratch coating is not 100% scratch-proof, it helps to prevent minor scratches that can easily happen to a regular lens.  These minor scratches can damage the surface of the lens and impair vision.  An anti-scratch coating acts as a protective layer thus making the lenses more durable and safe.\n\nFungal contamination of contact lenses\nMicrobial corneal infection is the most serious and \"most common vision threatening\" complication of contact lens wear, which is believed to be strongly associated with contact lens cases.  Such infections \"are being increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and blindness\" and \"may even be life-threatening.\"  While the cornea is believed to be the most common site for fungal eye infections, other parts of the eye such as the orbit, sclera, eyelids, and more may also be involved.  Contact lens cases are recognized as a \"potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers\" and according to Moorfields Eye Hospital, contact lens wear is “the most prevalent risk factor for new cases of corneal ulcers.”  Contaminants \"isolated from contact lens associated corneal ulcers have often been shown to be\" the same as found in the patient's contact lens case, thus providing evidence contaminated contact lens cases may be a \"replenishable source of pathogenic microbes.\"\n\nIntraocular lens\nIntraocular lens (IOL) is a lens implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for cataracts or myopia.  The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL.  These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed.  The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens.  The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens, and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia, or nearsightedness.  IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye.  IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials.  Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision.  However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.\n\nCapsulotomy\nCapsulotomy is a type of eye surgery in which an incision is made into the capsule of the crystalline lens of the eye.  In modern cataract operations, the lens capsule is usually not removed.  The most common forms of cataract surgery remove nearly all of the crystalline lens but do not remove the crystalline lens capsule (the outer “bag” layer of the crystalline lens).  The crystalline lens capsule is retained and used to contain and position the intraocular lens implant (IOL).\n\nPlasmat lens\nThe Plasmat lens is a widely used and long-established lens type invented by Paul Rudolph in 1918, especially common in large-format photography.  It provides high correction of aberrations with a moderate maximum aperture (e.g. f/5.6 ).  It is a specific instance of the Dagor type double-meniscus anastigmat.  Double-meniscus anastigmats use widely separated positive and negative surfaces, generally thick meniscus lenses, to achieve a flat field.  The most basic form is two sharply curved meniscus elements located symmetrically about a stop.  Further refinement of the form replaces the two simple meniscus lenses with achromats for chromatic correction.  The Dagor type further refines these achromats into triplets with the following design parameters: a high-index, doubly convex (DCX) lens cemented to a medium-index, doubly concave (DCV) lens cemented to a low-index meniscus lens.  Up to this point, all refinements have maintained symmetry about the stop.  The Plasmat further refines the Dagor form by uncementing the meniscus, allowing for placement away from the first two elements and removing the criterion of symmetry.\n\nThere Is No Authority But Yourself\nThere is No Authority But Yourself is a Dutch film directed by Alexander Oey documenting the history of anarchist punk band Crass.  The film features archive footage of the band and interviews with former members Steve Ignorant, Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher.  As well as reflecting on the band's past the film focusses on their current activities, and includes footage of Rimbaud performing with Last Amendment at the Vortex jazz club in Hackney, a compost toilet building workshop and a permaculture course held at Dial House in the spring of 2006.\n\nReisekamera\nThe Reisekamera, meaning a \"travel camera\", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost standardised design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, but not as cumbersome as the studio camera.  A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it might just as well be placed on a tabletop.  It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front.  The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks on either side of the baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane.  An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position.  The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the lens panel, by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen.  For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away.  The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions.  Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery.  However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel.\n\n"}
