{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Congressional Republicans on Friday evening revealed the final version of their massive tax bill, which appears likely to pass next week, the Washington Post reports. Here's some of what's included in the \"Tax Cut and Jobs Act\": The corporate tax rate is reduced from 35% to 21%, representing an approximately $1 trillion tax cut over the next decade. Despite Trump's claim the bill wouldn't cut taxes for the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans see their tax rate reduced from 39.6% to 37%. The bill also raises the income needed to hit that tax rate. People can inherit up to $11 million tax-free—an increase from $5.5 million—in changes to the estate tax. The bill lowers tax rates within all seven tax brackets, leading to lower taxes for most Americans, ABC News reports. But those cuts expire in eight years, and independent analyses have found people making under $75,000 will pay more in taxes over the next decade. The standard deduction is increased from $12,700 to $24,000 for joint filers and from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals. In a move seen as targeting blue states, the bill limits state, local, and property tax deductions to $10,000. Those deductions are unlimited under current law. The bill keeps popular deductions for student loan interest and medical expenses, as well as graduate students' tax break. The bill repeals the ObamaCare individual mandate and allows drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Hill reports. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act will be voted on next week, starting with the House on Tuesday. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes in the Senate, but there are currently no Republican senators on the record against the bill. Analysts have suggested tax cuts in the bill will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit and would likely not pay for themselves through economic growth, as Republicans and the Trump administration claim."}

Despite questions about skipping the standard approval process, \"it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention\" under the umbrella of \"compassionate use,\" WHO says in a statement. The FDA has given its OK for sample doses of the experimental drug ZMapp to be shipped to Liberia for use by doctors who have been afflicted with Ebola, reports CNN. While the AP notes that two infected Americans have appeared to respond well to ZMapp, a Spanish priest who also received the drug died today in Madrid, reports the BBC. But while some medical ethicists grapple with conundrums such as those documented by Vox.com, at least a few noted Ebola experts—including one who co-discovered the virus in 1976—tell the Los Angeles Times that \"dire circumstances call for a more robust international response\" and that access to drugs such as ZMapp should be given to African nations fighting the disease. A group set up by the Obama administration is also in the works to review information about the deadly virus and recommend whether and how to set policy for using untested drugs, reports Reuters."}

With a negotiated $400 in rent, the pod, which cost $1,300 to construct, seemed the perfect solution for a 25-year-old who couldn't afford a whole bedroom of his own in San Francisco's pricey market (median rent for a one-bedroom, per figures cited by Business Insider: $3,460). Unfortunately, it was an illegal solution. Though SFGate reports a door, windows, and a skylight open it up somewhat, the city's chief housing inspector tells Hoodline that Berkowitz \"would have to completely open it up\" to comply with housing, building, and fire safety codes. She suggests a bed surrounded by a curtain. William Strawn, with the department of building inspection, warns that a fire in the building could render Berkowitz \"toast\" and says space, air, and light requirements were being breached. It seems Berkowitz's ambitions, in addition to all the publicity and online photos, may have sunk him: Strawn tells Hoodline there was concern that Berkowitz \"is going out and trying to increase the number of these,\" ostensibly in response to an earlier Hoodline article that suggested he planned to sell pods to others. (A post on his website backs that up.) Berkowitz now says he was just trying to \"gauge interest\" in the idea, which he isn't moving forward with. But he has moved—out of the pod. He tells the Guardian he's \"100% concerned with doing this legally\" and the box has been dismantled. He's currently bunking with family. (Here's how to live in Manhattan for $1,375 a month.)"}

An official says the plan to deploy the Marines has \"been in the works for some time,\" though it appears in accordance with a Pentagon strategy outlined last month to boost the number of US troops in Syria so they can assist and advise allied Syrian fighters. A similar strategy was previously used in Mosul, Iraq—where 2,500 ISIS fighters reportedly remain—with local forces doing much of the fighting with support from US forces in bases outside the city.

Now it appears the Pentagon is preparing to do just that. Defense chief James Mattis is expected to sign an order authorizing at least 800 troops to head to the border, reports the AP. It wasn't immediately clear whether they'd be active-duty troops or members of the National Guard, or what their specific duties would be, reports CNN. But the best guess is that the troops would help shore up fencing and other barriers along parts of the border deemed vulnerable, rather than directly engaging with migrants attempting to cross illegally& The development comes as thousands of migrants from Central America continue to move north toward the US. In his tweet, Trump again blamed Democrats for weak immigration laws and quoted a guest on Fox & Friends. \"Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says ... that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border,\" wrote the president.

A rocket fired from California intercepted and destroyed a target warhead fired toward Alaska from the other side of the Pacific Ocean. It was the first-ever test of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system on a fast-moving \"ICBM-range target.\" “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent,” the director of the Missile Defense Agency says. The $244 million test was the first since 2014, according to NBC News. It was conducted amid increased worry of a potential nuclear attack from North Korea. Despite Tuesday's success, there are many questions surrounding the viability of the GMD system during an actual attack. Only nine of the previous 17 tests since 1999 had been successful, Reuters reports. And that's with tests being scripted for success: daytime launches with personnel informed of the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory. It's also possible North Korea could use decoys to trick the system; the GMD's interceptor rockets haven't been tested against decoys. A Pentagon spokesperson says the GMD system is just one way the Pentagon has of shooting down a potential North Korean missile. The GMD system has cost US taxpayers more than $40 billion so far."}

Since then, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (part of the NIH) has grown marijuana in concert with the school and then given it to federally approved researchers, all under the watchful eye of the DEA. Time reports a $68.8 million contract that will see the school continue to do so was awarded Monday; the solicitation notice was issued in late September, and a US News & World Report article published a month prior quoted a rep for NIDA as saying Ole Miss wasn't a given. But NIDA also said Ole Miss made the sole bid when the contract was last awarded, in 2009. Critics say NIDA disproportionately facilitates research into the downside of pot use, and foes of the University of Mississippi contract say its marijuana is of poor quality. NIDA required that any bidders have 12 acres for growing pot outdoors, another 1,000 square feet for growing it indoors, and \"emergency back-up systems.\" Everything must be monitored via video and secured in a vault. The Los Angeles Times in May took a look inside that steel vault, describing \"50-pound barrels ... brimming with dried, ready-to-smoke weed. ... Large metal canisters ... crammed full of hundreds of perfectly rolled joints [and] boxes of 'marijuana trash'— contaminated garbage that a crafty pothead might try to steal for a cheap high.\" As for the scientist who has been at the helm of the pot farm since 1980, Mahmoud ElSohly has some pretty conservative views: He's \"never ever\" tried pot, and thinks no one should smoke it: He favors a suppository that would transfer pot's benefits but not its high, as the rectum doesn't absorb THC.

Thorin's mother, Marcia Hess, immediately jumped down after him. \"I could see him dying, so I just called out to God … 'Get me down there, get me to my son!'\" she tells WBAL.

Soon after Madi started chest compressions on Thorin, he began gurgling, and he was conscious by the time emergency responders arrived. The toddler was taken to the hospital, where KIRO notes he's being treated for a potential lung infection from possibly breathing in sewage; other than that, he's said to be OK. \"They were saying, 'Chief ... 10 years from now, you need to give her a job,'\" East Pierce Fire Chief Bud Backer tells the News Tribune, adding that the girl followed all instructions \"to a 'T'\" and remained in control the entire time. \"She … saved her brother's life.\" Marcia Hess' take on her daughter's actions: \"This is an absolute miracle,\" she tells WBAL.

According to CNN's sources, former Breitbart national security editor Sebastian Gorka, who has been serving as a national security aide in the White House, will be leaving the administration this week. An administration official tells the AP that Gorka, a dual British-US citizen with Hungarian roots, had been hired for a role on White House strategist Bannon's Strategic Initiatives Group, a national security panel that group \"fizzled\" in the early months of the administration. Gorka was charged with taking a gun through a TSA checkpoint at Reagan National Airport last year, which made him unable to get a security clearance to serve on the National Security Council. The Guardian reports that Gorka's links to the far right in Hungary, where he attempted a career in politics before moving to the US, had been under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks.

The social media accounts of green card holders, permanent residents, and naturalized citizens can be surveilled by the federal government. According to Engadget, \"social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\" will be added to what DHS considers \"official records\" for immigrants. If DHS means things like Google search histories when it says \"search results,\" it's unclear how it plans to obtain those, Gizmodo notes.

That methodology contrasts with Anonymous' preferred method of launching distributed denial-of-service attacks that take jihadi websites offline. \"I don't think DDoS attacks do a huge amount of damage to Islamic State,\" the GSG director notes.

Per the Independent, 68 border collies performed a series of cognitive tasks (a \"dog IQ\" test, if you will), and scientists found not only did dogs who did well on one task tend to also have high performance on others, but that canines also develop dementia in a way similar to their two-legged owners—meaning study findings could potentially be applied to humans as well, notes Phys.org. Scientists carrying out the study, published in the Intelligence journal, had the dogs—whom a press release refers to as \"Mensa mutts\"—tested on navigational skills, how quickly they could find hidden food, if they could gauge differences in food quantities, and how well they could follow a human pointing gesture. The dogs who performed above average on one test not only performed well on others—they also tended to complete the tests faster. \"Just as people vary in their problem-solving abilities, so do dogs, even within one breed,\" Arden says. \"This is significant because in humans there is a small but measureable tendency for people who are brighter to be healthier and live longer.\" Which could eventually help figure out the true tie-in between intelligence and health, with so-called \"dognitive epidemiology\" perhaps even leading to treatments for dementia in humans. Why it may have been easier to conduct an intelligence test on dogs than on humans: Researchers didn't have to control for \"confounding\" factors such as lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking) and socioeconomic status. Plus, \"dogs are excellent for this kind of work because they are willing to participate and seem to enjoy taking part,\" a University of Edinburgh research fellow tells Phys.org.

An analysis at Deutsche Welle notes that the two leaders could hardly be more different in both personality and world view. She is often described as \"calm and collected,\" even \"bland,\" while Trump is, well, not bland. On politics, she favors global cooperation, while Trump advocates nationalism, and their views on immigration are generally at polar opposites. No shortage of topics could be on the agenda for what CNN calls this \"odd couple,\" and its story takes a look at some likely ones—Russia, NATO, trade, climate change, refugees, and counterterrorism—and the thorny complications of each.

And that's not all. The 60-year-old abruptly shifted from being happy and positive to sad and withdrawn, reports Live Science. Suspecting depression, they had her see doctors, and an MRI revealed glioblastoma multiforme, the aggressive type of brain cancer that Brittany Maynard suffered from. The National Brain Tumor Society doesn't mince words, calling it \"the most common, complex, treatment resistant, and deadliest type of brain cancer, accounting for 45% of all brain cancers.\" With tumors so big they couldn't be surgically removed, the woman was treated with anti-psychotic drugs sometimes given to glioblastoma patients and chemo and radiation over five weeks; her religious visions ultimately ceased. The doctors write in the journal Neurocase that because she previously believed in God, hers \"was not a case of religious conversion.\" And as there was no \"trigger or reason [for the hyper-religiosity] except for the disease ... it can be considered a clearly pathological experience.\" The researchers suggest that this is not the first such case, writing that \"in some cases, religiosity can appear as a pathological correlate in patients with brain lesions\"; but they present no data as to how often this might occur. The patient died eight months after being diagnosed with cancer. (This man credits Facebook for helping spot his brain tumor.)"}

In a Telegraph op-ed, Johnson argued the face-covering veil shouldn't be banned in Britain as it is in Denmark, but had unkind words for female wearers. It's \"absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes … looking like a bank robber,\" Johnson wrote, per the Globe and Mail. After dozens of complaints, an independent panel is investigating whether his comments violated the Conservative Party's code of conduct, which says MPs should \"foster respect and tolerance\" and avoid using their position \"to bully, abuse, victimize, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others,\" reports the BBC. Though she avoided describing the comments as Islamophobic, Prime Minister Theresa May was among the first to rebuke Johnson for language that \"offended people.\" She's called on him to apologize, as has party chairman Brandon Lewis, among others. Johnson, believed to be vacationing in Europe, has yet to do so. Some suggest that's because the possible candidate for future party leader meant to appeal to right-wing voters. \"I sincerely hope that he doesn't continue to use Muslim women as a convenient political football to try and increase his poll ratings,\" former Tory chairman Sayeeda Warsi tells the Guardian.

Audiences are giving it a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but critics are less impressed. Some say it's better than the first flick, but that's apparently not saying much. Here's what critics are saying: The first installment was \"tepid,\" but new screenwriters have \"done serious surgery to Insurgent, streamlining the story line, changing key plot points, ... and in general improving the narrative flow,\" Kenneth Turan writes at the Los Angeles Times. \"The result—though admittedly it's a low bar to clear—is a more effective, adult-friendly film than its predecessor.\" Still, the heart of the movie is in its action sequences, which \"are nothing if not traditional B-movie material.\" Tom Long at the Detroit News writes that Insurgent, \"while far from perfect, has a crackling energy that can't be denied.\" The visuals are \"mostly dazzling\" but the movie \"is all on [Shailene] Woodley (the camera rarely leaves her) and she's more than capable ... of pulling it off.\" Naomi Watts and Kate Winslet are also strong, but the franchise remains what Long calls \"a poorer cousin of The Hunger Games.\" And the \"just-in-the-nick-of-time climax is fairly laughable.\" Insurgent overcomes \"middle-book-itis\" and \"moves the story forward significantly,\" writes Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle. But it's \"ridiculous.\" The \"world of the film is so far-fetched that the mechanics of its functioning are of no interest. What's worse, the behavior of the characters often goes against the movie's own internal logic.\" Interestingly, the good parts are \"saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, 'Well, that was OK,' even though most of it wasn't.\" At one point, Woodley's character says, \"I know this doesn't make any sense.\" Chimes in Claudia Puig at USA Today: \"That sentiment pretty much sums up this listless sequel.\" It \"feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014's Divergent, and lacks tension and excitement,\" she writes.

One 15-year-old tells the Guardian he takes three smoke breaks a day on his school's playground, where he's encouraged to smoke and an ashtray is provided. It sounds like a stereotypical French scene—only it wasn't always this way. In fact, it's \"one of the weirdest results\" of the November terror attacks in Paris, reports Vice News. Officials feared crowds of students smoking outside schools would become easy targets for terrorists, so special measures under a state of emergency were used to encourage outdoor smoking areas on school grounds. \"It's safer for us,\" says one student. But another says the move was a surprise. \"Teachers have spent so long telling us smoking is bad for us and here they are giving us a special area of the school courtyard to do it in. Wow!\" she says, adding the change has probably helped some pupils smoke more often. A doctor—who notes 30 schools around Paris are allowing smoking on school grounds—fears it will also encourage others to take up the habit. Some 125,000 of France's current high school students will die from smoking over the next 30 years, he says, noting, \"That's huge compared to terror attacks.\" The Ministry of Education says officials are \"very committed to the fight against addiction and smoking,\" adding school principals have the final say on whether to allow smoking.

Their class-action lawsuit attacking the company for luring clueless children with \"addictive,\" expensive game apps was recently given the go-ahead by a San Jose judge. Games are \"highly addictive, designed deliberately to be so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 per purchase or more,\" according to court documents. The apps can often be downloaded for free, but kids can rack up big bills purchasing extra levels and items. \"Smurfberries,\" for example, which serve as currency in the Smurfs game, sell in batches costing up to $59, notes MSNBC. Children are usually not required to provide credit card information, and the costs are automatically billed to parents' iTunes accounts.

In one case, a 7-year-old British boy racked up a $2,000 bill on an iPad buying animals for the Tap Zoo game, reports the Daily Mail.

That's what you could see in the night sky over the next week or so as the Taurid meteor shower makes its annual appearance, USA Today reports. The cosmic show, which can be viewed anytime from late October through the end of this month, is set to peak from Thursday to Nov. 12 and will be visible to US viewers. And Mother Nature Network notes this could be one of the best displays ever, thanks to an atypically heavy debris field from the comet—meaning more of the shooting stars than usual—and the lack of a full moon. An AccuWeather meteorologist notes that viewers typically see up to 10 meteors per hour. How the fireballs come about: As the Encke comet orbits the sun, it leaves a trail of dust and ice particles, per USA Today. As our planet moves through that debris field, the particles zip through our atmosphere at up to 65,000mph, burning up and resulting in the spectacular trails we see in the sky. (The fireball seen in this video is said to have been recorded in Bangkok earlier this week.) With this particular meteor shower, they appear to emerge from the Taurus constellation: The South Taurids, seen south of the star pattern, peak Thursday night; the North Taurids peak Nov. 12, Space.com reports. The best time to catch a peek: After midnight, when there's little moonlight and Taurus is high up above.

The case is generating headlines because Phillips preached a brand of Christianity known as \"Quiverfull\" or \"patriarchal\" that emphasizes female submission and constant child-bearing, and the Duggars ot TLC fame were followers and friends. In fact, \"it's hard to underestimate the importance of Phillips in the small world of extreme fundamentalists,\" writes Amanda Marcotte at the Daily Beast.

The lawsuit alleges that he \"methodically groomed\" and manipulated her for years in the guise of a spiritual mentor, until she moved into his house as a sort of nanny around age 21. At that point, the suit says he coerced her into sexual encounters, and her lawyers maintain that she was so brainwashed she was incapable of consent. “Women within this movement are perceived to exist only for the end-goals communicated by the male leaders that perceive themselves as the ‘patriarchs’ of this world,” the lawsuit reads."}

Still, the deal is expected to pass both the House and Senate and avert a shutdown, reports the Hill. Politico sees Ryan's criticism as his \"starkest public split\" with the outgoing Boehner, but notes that the deal \"helps Ryan immensely\" because \"it sets budget levels for two years, lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017 and removes the threat of a government shutdown until October 2016.\" But with most Republicans likely to vote against it, Ryan seems to be giving himself a healthy distance from the particulars.

That's exactly what researchers say they may be able to do in a study published Monday in Nature Human Behavior. Currently, most treatments for phobias and PTSD involve drugs, which can have side effects, or aversion therapy, which requires patients to be exposed to their fears, according to a press release. But the researchers behind the study say their technique—decoded neurofeedback, or DecNef—can \"remove specific fears from the brain\" using brain scanning technology and artificial intelligence. Researchers created a fear memory in volunteers by shocking them when they saw a certain color, the Guardian reports. The brain pattern created by that new fear would occasionally reappear subconsciously, without the volunteer being afraid or thinking about it. When that happened, researchers gave the volunteer a reward. Eventually, the fear memory was overwritten. Researchers believe they can substantially reduce phobias and PTSD if they can figure out the brain patterns associated with common fears, such as spiders. Researcher Mitsuo Kawato hopes to start \"systematic DecNef therapy\" within a few years. (Your fear may make this spider look huge.)"}

One psychologist tells the Post that schools have found success in serving vegetables on their own, thus eliminating the competition. \"We tested it with kids in school cafeterias, where it more than quadrupled the amount of vegetables eaten.\" (Or, just do what Congress did and declare pizza a vegetable.)"}

Although the ban on the 500- and 1,000-rupee notes was meant to flush out so-called \"black money\" (stashed cash that hasn't been subject to taxes; India says only 1% of its people paid income taxes in 2013), opposition parties claim the decision was a rash one that's placed citizens in economic upheaval: The two notes made up 86% of the country's in-circulation currency. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calls the ban \"monumental mismanagement\"; earlier this month, the Guardian compared the move to \"the failed experiments of dictatorships.\" Demonetization protests have taken place in Lucknow, Kolkata (with a reported 25,000 in attendance), and Bangalore, with the states of Kerala and Tripura experiencing a disruption of \"normal life\" that has brought things in some areas to a \"standstill,\" the Indian Express reports. People's attempts to get their hands on legal currency have been described as \"chaotic,\" per the BBC, with banks and ATMs running out of money. (This BBC article clearly explains the limits on exchanging and depositing 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, and the tax implications.)

This week, the tabloid has still featured photos of scantily clad women there (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in lingerie yesterday; two actresses in bikinis today), but their breasts are covered up. Activists had been railing against the \"Page 3 girls\" feature in recent years, calling it sexist, AFP reports. According to the Times, Murdoch himself called the tradition \"old-fashioned\" last year and a change has been in the works ever since. Even so, it was just after Murdoch bought the Sun that the tradition began, back in 1970 with German model Stephanie Rahn. Since then, models like Samantha Fox and Katie Price have seen their careers launched by the page. But the Sun's PR head insists to AFP that there's no official confirmation from the tabloid that the tradition is definitively over, and AFP also notes that in today's edition, readers were informed they could see topless photos online instead (the Guardian notes that viewers are being directed to Page3.com). Lucy-Anne Holmes, the actress who started the No More Page 3 campaign in 2012, wasn't exactly effusive in her praise of the move: \"The Sun hasn't suddenly decided that women say, think, and do interesting and incredible things,\" she tells the BBC. \"It's still basically saying women are here for decoration, but it's a step in the right direction.\""}

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Did rehab actually make Cory Monteith more vulnerable? Doctors explain to USA Today that drug users can be at higher risk of overdosing after leaving rehab if they aren't able to stay clean. Because heroin users build up a tolerance to the drug—which contributed to Monteith's death—they have to use more in order to feel any effects. But after detoxing, addicts' bodies can no longer handle those big amounts, and former addicts who relapse are likely to immediately revert back to the same big dose. That can kill them, one expert explains. As for the fatal dose of heroin, Monteith was alone in his hotel room when he took it, Vancouver police say, according to Radar. His death is particularly tragic, one friend tells Radar, in light of the fact that he previously kicked addictions to ecstasy and heroin. \"Cory fought his demons and the demons won,\" another friend tells E!. \"Cory wasn't going out and doing these things to have fun. He couldn't stop. He tried. He just couldn't.\" One of his demons: the fame that came from his role on Glee. It \"was hard for him,\" yet another friend tells People, something \"he never quite knew how to handle.\" It was the Glee cast and producers who convinced Monteith to go to rehab earlier this year when it became clear he was using heroin, TMZ reports, and Monteith was \"grateful\" for their support.

The findings, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, are described as \"the first national estimates of indoor tanning–related injuries treated in US hospital emergency departments.\" That estimate places those ER-worthy injuries at an average of 3,234 per year. As the Washington Post puts it, \"that's nearly nine skin burns, fainting spells, eye injuries, lacerations, strains, sprains, bruises, or dislocations every day that could have been avoided.\" And the true number is likely much higher, since the research excluded those injuries that were dealt with by private physicians, urgent care centers, or at home. Skin burns account for roughly 80% of the injuries; the majority of those who sustain any type of injury are women (82.2%) and between 18 and 34 (62.4%). The one encouraging figure: the injuries nosedived during the 2003-to-2012 period that was studied: from 6,487 at the start to 1,957 in 2012, reports USA Today. Researcher Gery P. Guy suspects the decline is tied to the declining use of tanning beds. Still, he notes these injuries could lead to bigger issues down the line, as skin and eye burns up the risk for skin cancer and eye melanoma, respectively. A tanning industry rep points out that 1 million people tan indoors daily, meaning the injury rate is incredibly tiny."}

Trump denial: “There was no collusion,” Trump said, per the Washington Post. “I didn’t know the president. There was nobody to collude with.

Makers of a PBS documentary on the project, Colosseum: Roman Death Trap, also had an adult male wolf pulled up, but the animal got a biscuit to snack on, not a person. \"It was the first time that a wild animal had been released into the Colosseum in 1,500 years,\" says Gary Glassman, who directed the film. \"I would love to have used a lion, but there were obvious safety issues involved,\" he adds.

Researchers out of Switzerland's University of Lausanne studied the marijuana habits of 3,400 participants beginning as young adults via data compiled over 25 years. About 84% of participants reported past marijuana use and 11% continued to smoke into middle age, per Medical Daily. To study usage on the same scale, they tallied a person's marijuana-years of exposure—a figure referring to every 365 days a person smoked weed, whether spread across a single year or seven. While scientists found no link between exposure and brain function or processing speed, they did find verbal memory slackened slightly after the equivalent of five years of daily marijuana use. Essentially, someone who smoked marijuana every day for five years could recall 8.5 out of 15 words they were told to memorize 25 minutes earlier, compared to nine words for non-users, per the Washington Post. But each year of exposure added more damage. Researchers estimate a person who smoked pot daily for 25 years would remember 2.5 fewer words than their non-smoking counterparts. None of the study participants actually claimed 25 years of pot use—just 8% managed five years—but marijuana use is on the rise.

The image was discovered in the 1990s in a network of limestone caves on the eastern edge of the island, NPR reports. And, recently, researchers used dating technology to determine the painting to be at least 40,000 years old—older than similar paintings in Europe by more than 4,000 years, per Science. Rather than being simply an “abstract design,” as older cave paintings are, figurative paintings like the cow portrait are “clearly like someone decided to depict what they saw,” says Australian archaeologist Maxime Aubert, who published his team’s “amazing” findings in Nature. “The meaning of the animal is unknown,” Aubert says, per USA Today, “We think it wasn’t just food for them. It meant something special.” The cave where the cow image was discovered is a “vast and ancient gallery,” says National Geographic. The prehistoric artwork includes other animal renderings, paintings of stick figure humans with headdresses and spears, and stencils of human hands made by blowing liquid ochre over a hand pressed against rock, the earliest of which are more than 50,000 years old. According to Aubert, ancient artists added new images to the cave over a span of 30,000 years. (Some ancient artists were high when they created their abstract paintings.)"}

Authorities say Donald Webb vanished nearly 40 years ago after shooting and killing a police officer in Saxonburg, Penn., during a traffic stop on Dec. 4, 1980. Webb was charged with first-degree murder and on Dec. 31, 1980, a federal warrant was issued for his arrest alleging unlawful flight. In 1981 Webb was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Authorities believe Webb shot Chief Gregory Adams while planning a jewelry store heist. He was wanted at the time for an attempted burglary in New York.

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– There's a new enemy in the battle against global warming: reservoirs. Researchers studying more than 250 of the world's reservoirs found they produce the equivalent of 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide every year, the Washington Post reports. According to Popular Science, that's about the same amount of greenhouse gas as Brazil produces annually and includes 25% more methane than previously believed. About 79% of the greenhouse gases emitted by reservoirs is methane (the rest is carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide). That's not great news as methane is about 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to exacerbating global warming, Phys.org reports. Reservoirs produce more greenhouse gases than natural bodies of water because they include more organic matter in the water—the grasses and trees that were flooded, runoff from nearby farms—for microorganisms to break down. Unfortunately, more and more reservoirs are being built, especially in developing countries and as a way to meet climate change goals, the Christian Science Monitor reports. So it now appears hydropower, which uses reservoirs, may not be as green as previously believed. Researchers say it's time the world starts paying attention to reservoirs. They produce about as much methane as rice paddies and biomass burning but aren't included in international emissions estimates like those other two. (California is going after its farting cows.)"}

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Go west, young tree! A study published Wednesday in Science Advances finds the trees of eastern American forests are on the move—and none too slowly, either. The study looked at 86 tree species between 1980 and 2015, Smithsonian reports. Over those 35 years, 73% of the trees saw their population centers move westward, and 62% saw them move northward. According to Science Alert, westbound trees moved by about 9.5 miles per decade; northward trees moved about 6.8 miles per decade. The trees themselves weren't moving, Groot-style; instead their population centers shifted as saplings sprouted up in new areas and trees in older areas died off, the Atlantic explains. Scientists have long expected tree populations to move north in search of cooler temperatures as the effects of climate change increase. However, the move west was unexpected—and difficult to explain. “When the result came out that trees are moving westward, our eyeballs opened wide,\" study author Songlin Fei says. \"Like, ‘Wow, what’s going on with this?'\" Researchers hypothesize that climate change-related shifts in precipitation are causing the westward movement. The Great Plains have received much more precipitation than normal over the past few decades, while the Southeast has received much less. But, the researchers admit precipitation can only account for about 20% of the westward movement. (Newly discovered forests could cover 60% of Australia.)"}

A few hours later, after the girl wouldn't wake up from a nap, babysitter Syna Lim, now 48, tried for two hours to reach Amara's parents before getting hold of the father. When Amara finally arrived at the hospital, she was brain dead. Three years later, a jury found Lim guilty of the girl's murder, convicting her of beating the toddler with the handle of a flyswatter and hitting her on the head. She was sentenced to life in prison. But last week, the conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered, the Florida Times-Union reports. New evidence has found that Amara may not have been beaten to death after all, but may have died due to undiagnosed juvenile diabetes and another condition that causes uncontrolled internal bleeding. A pathologist and a pediatrician re-examined the case years later and testified that Amara had very high blood sugar levels at the time of her death, which caused the internal bleeding. That bleeding, in turn, would have led to the bruises found on Amara that could be mistaken as coming from a beating. The doctors told the court that not enough medical testing was done on Amara at the hospital, News 4 Jax reports. The case brings up questions about the medical examiner who performed Amara's autopsy, the Times-Union notes: She resigned in 2010, and allegations have swirled that she was experiencing early symptoms of Alzheimer's before she resigned.

(See the anonymous blog McMansion Hell for examples.) They were pricier to build than the average starter ranch-style house, and they also sell for more, but as Bloomberg reports using Trulia stats, their investment value has \"dropped like a stone.\" In 85% of the largest US markets, that extra amount people are willing to pay for McMansions is shrinking. Case in point: A typical McMansion in Fort Lauderdale was valued at $477,000 in 2012, a 274% premium over all other area homes. Now they're worth $611,000, which is just 190% more. The move away from the McMansion trend of 10 years ago appears to be widespread across age groups as well, with Baby Boomers looking to downsize, Gen Xers licking their wounds from post-bubble foreclosures, and millennials not marrying and starting families at the same rate previous generations did. Plus, builders have been more cautious in the intervening years, with more new construction being smaller (though still sizeable, with 2,500-square-footers being the median). And it's not just McMansions, as the Chicago Tribune reports. Luxury homes built long before McMansions came along are also slow to sell, and prices for any homes and condos listed above $1 million have dropped 9% during the first three months of 2016.

Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have been saying each others' names for months, but they haven't actually spent any time face-to-face. \"The chemistry between the two candidates cannot be rehearsed,\" the New York Times observes, and it could be crucial. Stagecraft: Everything else, however, has been rehearsed—the candidates have even agreed on such details as how many family members can come onstage after the debate. Which Romney? The challenger is getting conflicting advice about how he should approach the debate, Politico reports, with some urging him to attack, and others worrying that he'll put off voters if he charges too hard, given Obama's high personal approval rating. One senior adviser tells the Times that in rehearsal he's shot for \"respectfully aggressive.\" Will Obama go negative? Obama faces a similar problem, Politico points out; his lead is based on a summer of relentless attacks on Romney. Can he keep attacking him to his face without endangering those personal approval ratings? Libya is domestic, right? This debate is supposed to focus on domestic issues, but Romney advisers tell the Times they want to bring up Obama's response to the Benghazi embassy attack. It's the economy, mostly: But the main issue of the debate will be the economy. We can guarantee this, because the first three of the debate's six 15-minute segments are titled The Economy I, The Economy II, and The Economy III, the AP reports. Just the facts: Both candidates have had some trouble telling the truth this cycle, so the Times has run a kind of pre-fact check on the debate, listing claims the candidates are likely to make on debt, taxes, and Medicare, and how to evaluate them. Tie goes to the challenger: In good news for Mitt Romney, the first debate has a statistically significant history of helping the challenger, Nate Silver finds.

Still, it holds \"enough dino-mite action to stave off excitement extinction.\" Audiences will flock to the film regardless of what he writes, but Joe Morgenstern writes it anyway: \"Something should be said about the film's cheesiness—it doesn't even look good, though it sounds grand—and the shoddiness of its workmanship.\" Pratt offers an easy charm, but he's \"no match for the crude filmmaking or the stupid plot that keeps him running around in a constant state of artificial animation,\" he writes at the Wall Street Journal.

A new study suggests that all life on Earth may have originated on the Red Planet, the BBC reports.

On Earth, those minerals would have dissolved into the ocean (water is \"corrosive\" to RNA, adds Space.com). But life could have formed on Mars, then headed here on meteorites, suggests US scientist Steven Benner; he's not the first to propose such a theory, the BBC notes. The investigation centers on how atoms were arranged to form RNA, DNA, and proteins. Benner says minerals containing the elements boron and an oxidized form of molybdenum were central to the process—but at the time, Earth was probably incapable of supporting enough of such minerals. He tells Space.com that analysis of a Martian meteorite revealed the presence of boron on Mars, and \"we now believe that the oxidized form of molybdenum was there, too.\" As such, \"the evidence seems to be building that we are actually all Martians; that life started on Mars and came to Earth on a rock,\" says Benner. \"It’s lucky that we ended up here, nevertheless—as certainly Earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life.\" Click for more on how nobody really wants to head back there."}

The men and women in the empathy study, published in PNAS, were asked to rank 20 statements that measured either empathy—ie, \"I can easily work out what another person might want to talk about\"—or \"systems-oriented thinking,\" such as asking how interested participants were in knowing \"the path a river takes from its source to the sea.\" Men, on average, got a score of 9.87 out of 20 for empathy, while their female counterparts scored 10.79; for analytical thinking, men achieved a score of 6.73, women 5.45. What plays a part in determining individual differences in empathy, per Varun Warrier, one of the study's co-authors: our genes, our environment, and what hormones we're exposed to in the womb. In an accompanying data set to the main study, the scientists also found backup to support what a release calls the \"Extreme Male Brain\" theory of autism: that autistic people are more apt to have \"masculinized\" traits and aren't as likely to get big numbers on empathy, but will score as high or higher on tests of systemizing.

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– The bathing suit areas of Florida swimmers are under attack by an invisible enemy: sea lice. ABC News reports experts expect to see widespread outbreaks of sea lice this summer, especially in the Gulf of Mexico. Sea lice are incredibly tiny jellyfish larvae that are invisible in the water. They get stuck between swimmers' skin and bathing suits or hair and start stinging. That leads to seabather's eruption—aka pika-pika or ocean itch, according to CNN. The itchy rash can last for two weeks. KTRK reports it can also cause chills, nausea, and fever. Authorities say the best way to avoid the rash is to wear as little clothing as possible while swimming. If you do get stung—you likely won't notice until a few hours later when the itching starts—rub the area with sand or a credit card's edge, then rinse with hot water. Swimmers in areas where sea lice are present should take off their swimsuits before showering and rinse them with vinegar or rubbing alcohol. Outbreaks of sea lice have already been confirmed in Florida, and the tiny creatures are possibly heading toward Alabama, WKRG reports."}

But until recently those films were literally rotting away in top-secret storage. Gregg Spriggs, a weapons physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, tells Paleofuture the films were \"on the brink\" of being \"useless.\" Not anymore. Spriggs has scanned 4,200 of the films to digital and gotten 750 of them declassified. And this week he posted 65 of the films—an \"initial set\"—to YouTube. \"I think that if we capture the history of this and show what the force of these weapons are and how much devastation they can wreak, then maybe people will be reluctant to use them,\" Spriggs says. He isn't just preserving the nuclear test footage for historical purposes but to learn as much as possible from it scientifically, the Verge reports. Atmospheric nuclear testing has been banned since 1963, and these old films represent some of the best data available for scientists in the present. Spriggs' laboratory has found about 6,500 of the test films. He says it will take two years to digitize the rest of them and many more years after that to get them declassified.

The Wrap reports actress Aurora Perrineau filed a police report Friday with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in which she accuses Murray Miller, a writer and executive producer on Girls, of sexually assaulting her in 2012. Perrineau, who says she passed a polygraph in September, says she was out with friends when the then-35-year-old Miller started flirting with her despite her telling him multiple times she was only 17. She says she and her friends gave him a ride to his house, and “at some point, I woke up in Murray’s bed naked. He was on top of me having sexual intercourse with me. At no time did I consent to any sexual contact.\" Dunham and Girls co-creator Jenni Konner issued a statement Friday saying they are \"confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year,\" People reports.

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Lawyers for Duane Edward Buck are urging Texas Gov. Rick Perry to step in and stay their client's execution, scheduled for tomorrow, citing racially biased testimony presented at his sentencing hearing. Texas law requires juries to decide if a defendant poses a “future danger” when deciding whether to give the death penalty, the LA Times explains. Prosecutors brought up “the race factor,” asking defense psychologist Walter Quijano if being black made Buck more likely to be dangerous. Quijano said it did, and prosecutors cited that in their closing arguments. Quijano gave similar testimony in six other cases, and in each case the defendants were given new sentencing hearings. Buck, whose guilt is not being questioned, shot two people while on drugs in 1995, but had no prior history of violence—a fact Quijano noted meant he was unlikely to pose a future danger. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted against recommending clemency yesterday, despite calls to do so from one of the people he shot and one of the case’s prosecutors, the Texas Tribune reports.

The dispatcher initially didn't realize Trickle was referring to himself until he clarified, \"No, I'm the one.\" She asked him to wait for help, to no avail. Trickle's brother in Las Vegas says the retired driver had been in near-constant pain of late, but doctors couldn't figure out the problem, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “He was very down,” says Chuck Trickle. \"He more or less said he didn’t know how much longer he could take the pain,\" which was located under his left breast. Trickle had been a terrific short-track driver early in his career before shifting to NASCAR as a 48-year-old in 1989, reports CNN. Though he didn't win any marquee NASCAR races, Trickle gained renown thanks to his, er, unique name. ESPN's Keith Olbermann went out of his way to mention it during NASCAR coverage. Upon hearing the news yesterday, Olbermann offered up a tweet in tribute: \"No sports figure Dan (Patrick and) I had fun with took it more graciously. In fact, gratefully.\""}

The mansion also comes with a pajama-clad built-in resident, 90-year-old Hugh Hefner, who will live out the rest of his days in the estate where he spent his glory days. It was the largest residential sale in LA history, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The buyer was next-door neighbor financier Daren Metropoulos, 33, who said, “I feel fortunate and privileged to now own a one-of-a-kind piece of history and art.” Playboy Enterprises will pay Metropoulos $1 million a year in upkeep for the remainder of Hef's life; as part of the deal, Metropoulos agreed to give Hef plenty of notice when he wants to visit. Playboy Enterprises paid $1.1 million for the Gothic Tudor-style mansion in 1971. With 20,000 square feet, 29 rooms, a tennis court, and a swimming pool, there was plenty of space for Hefner to throw some of LA’s most hedonistic parties, which he stocked with Playboy bunnies and bawdy entertainment for A-list guests like, er, Bill Cosby. In recent years, though, as the aging magnate’s health declined, life at the mansion seemed decidedly less fun, less-than-thrilled guests told the Mirror. (A recent visitor panned it as “kinda depressing,” Vice reports.) After Hef’s tenancy, er, ends, Metropoulos, plans to combine the property with a 2.3-acre property next-door he bought in 2009 and use it as his own personal residence.

He was introduced as \"Congressman-elect Lamb\" at a Hilton Inn campaign party, even as officials were counting hundreds of absentee ballots, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. \"It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it. You did it!\" said Lamb, whose Republican opponent, Rick Saccone, has not conceded. Unofficial results put Lamb ahead by around 600 votes. The margin is narrow enough for supporters of either side to get a recount if they can find three voters in the same precinct who attest to error or fraud, the AP reports. The district voted for President Trump by 20 points in 2016 and has been so reliably Republican in recent years that Democrats didn't field a candidate in the 2014 and 2016 House races, meaning the result will be a major worry for the GOP heading into the midterms even if it ends up as a narrow Republican win, the New York Times notes. Trump campaigned in the district and Republican-aligned outside groups spent more than $10 million on the race, even though the winner will only hold the seat for eight months. \"The real impact of this race has to do more with the symbolism of the outcome as a harbinger of things to come, and as a reflection of President Trump’s popularity,\" pollster Chris Borick tells the Post-Gazette."}
{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Just five prosecutors representing less than 0.2% of US counties are responsible for 14% of all people currently on death row and 5% of people sentenced to death in the past 40 years. That's according to a recently released report from Harvard Law School's Fair Punishment Project. The report—subtitled \"How overzealous personalities drive the death penalty\"—found the death penalty was more about prosecutors cultivating an \"over-aggressive\" and \"reckless\" style than the actual crimes, the Huffington Post reports. And, according to the Guardian, that leads to a \"highly arbitrary\" use of the death penalty. The five prosecutors, who have sentenced a total of 440 people to death, are Joe Britt in North Carolina, Bob Macy in Oklahoma, Lynne Abraham in Pennsylvania, Johnny Holmes in Texas, and Donnie Myers in South Carolina. Only Myers is still serving as a prosecutor. All five prosecutors seem to relish securing the death penalty. Myer has an electric chair paperweight. Macy, who got a 16-year-old sentenced to death, saw it as his \"patriotic duty.\" Abraham says she's never doubted one of her death sentences, despite two of them later being exonerated. And that leads to another problem: the \"illegal or unethical behavior\" that seems to go hand-in-hand with a passion for the death penalty. Misconduct was found in a third of Macy's 54 death sentences, and three of them were exonerated. Britt was found to have committed misconduct in more than a third of his 38 death sentences and had two developmentally disabled teens exonerated. Myers was found to have a 46% misconduct rate, often for excluding jurors on the basis of race. He once referred to a black defendant as \"King Kong\" and a \"beast of burden.\" Read the full report here."}

Fernande Grudet—more commonly known as Madame Claude—ran a high-class call-girl ring catering to the rich and famous in the 1960s and 1970s in Paris. According to AFP, her clients included the Shah of Iran, Marlon Brando, and Moammar Gadhafi. \"It was so exciting to hear a millionaire or a head of state ask, in a little boy’s voice, for the one thing that only you could provide,\" the Times quotes Grudet as saying. The BBC notes Grudet liked to muddle her personal history, claiming—almost certainly falsely—that she was raised in a convent. And the Times notes it's unclear exactly how Grudet built her call-girl empire. But at the height of her business, Grudet employed more than 500 \"swans,\" AFP reports. According to the Times, Grudet would recruit girls who were \"foreign, from the fringes of the film and fashion worlds, with a sprinkling of students looking for extra cash and housewives looking for adventure.\" One columnist says Grudet sought out girls who couldn't quite make it as models and actresses, but that \"didn’t mean they weren’t beautiful, fabulous.\" Her swans had to know literature and current events, and their sexual talents were tested. One night with a swan could cost a client $1,500 in today's dollars. But it wasn't all glamour. \"She was like a slave driver in the American South,\" an actress who played Grudet once said. \"It was sexual indentured servitude.\" Grudet had multiple stays in jail in the 1980s and 1990s."}

A criminal complaint describes how the woman seated in front of Alexander initially felt a hand touch her right breast but thought it might've been an accident, per KHOU and the Albuquerque Journal. She later felt a hand move from the back of her arm to her ribs and again to her breast, this time \"attentively,\" and \"told the passenger behind her that she didn't know why he thought it was OK and he needed to stop,\" per the complaint. The woman was moved to another seat for the remainder of the flight, which was greeted by law enforcement in Albuquerque due to \"reports of a customer's alleged inappropriate behavior onboard.\" Federal agents say 49-year-old Alexander denied touching the woman despite his reference to the 2005 Access Hollywood tape on which President Trump is heard bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. He also said he slept for most of the flight and wasn't drinking or taking sleep medication. However, his hands matched those the victim described as being thick-fingered and hairy, with dirty finger nails, per the complaint. Alexander, who reportedly asked about a possible sentence, faces up to two years in prison if convicted. A preliminary hearing is set for Tuesday, reports ABC News.

The Cruz camp's supposed strategy: to influence Texas, and eight other state conventions happening this week, in picking a total of 389 delegates (about one-fifth of the total) so he can then get people he trusts to dump Trump and perhaps force a contested convention.

The letter notes that, as of May 4, \"Senator Ted Cruz is no longer a candidate for President of the United States. As of that date, his 2018 campaign for the United States Senate and his campaign committee Ted Cruz for Senate have been reactivated.\" That official reactivation means his Senate campaign committee can now raise money for a reelection bid, per NBC DFW. Cruz was also asked point-blank at a Wednesday press conference if he planned to vie for Senate again, per CNN, to which he simply responded, \"Yes.\" Cruz was back at Capitol Hill Tuesday, warmly greeted by some with applause and fist bumps, but others, such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen.

Sales of other fizzy waters like Perrier and San Pellegrino have also spiked recently, while Sparkling Ice sales jumped from $27 million in 2010 to $550 million last year, the Washington Post reported. But big brands like Coke and Pepsi aren't having as much success. Whereas the market share for LaCroix maker, National Beverage—the fourth-largest soda maker in North America—rose 67% from 2010 to 2014, Coke and Pepsi's market shares fell 4% and 5.5%, respectively. Why are people attracted to a neon can that looks like it came straight out of the 1980s? A major advantage is that it avoids corporate associations, notes Bloomberg. Then there are the flavors—12 in total including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse (grapefruit), per Grist—which have attracted a kind of indie cult following. National Beverage says the flavors are based on a secret brew of \"natural essence.\" But for one young consumer, who used LaCroix to help kick his energy drink and soda habit, \"it's less about the taste\" and \"more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing and it can replace soda.\" LaCroix—which got a \"letter of recommendation\" in the New York Times Magazine in March—is certainly marketing itself as a soda alternative.

But it's now clear that the mummy did indeed hail from South America, the BBC reports, where she was killed by blunt-force trauma to the head; the researchers suspect the killing came as part of a ritual sacrifice. Though the mummy visually appeared relatively normal, a CT scan showed \"she must have received a couple of really severe hits by a sharp object,\" study co-author Andreas Nerlich of Munich University tells LiveScience. \"The skull bones that had been destroyed fell into her brain cavity, and they are still there today.\" An analysis of isotopes in her hair revealed a fish- and maize-heavy diet, indicating she likely lived near the Peruvian or northern Chilean coast—according to carbon dating, sometime between AD 1451 and 1642. After death, she was buried in a hot, dry, and sandy region that facilitated natural mummification. The researchers learned the woman wasn't long for this world anyway: She also suffered from Chagas disease, a parasitic infection that would have killed her.

A newly released court transcript sheds the most light yet on the thinking of Judge Aaron Persky in handing down the controversial sentence, reports the Guardian. For example, Persky mentioned a letter written by a childhood friend of Turner's who called the crime out of character for Turner. \"To me, that just rings true as to—it sort of corroborates the evidence of his character up until the night of this incident, which has been positive,\" said Persky. (The letter writer, a female, has since apologized after critics accused her of blaming the victim.) Persky also addressed the victim's concern that if Turner had been a minority from an underprivileged home, he surely would have gotten a longer sentence than six months. The judge flipped the logic on that one, saying that Turner's upbringing shouldn't count against him because he faced \"a huge collateral consequence\" over the arrest. \"I think you have to take the whole picture in terms of what impact imprisonment has on a specific individual’s life,\" he said. Or as the Guardian sums up, Persky felt \"Turner had more to lose.\" Persky also said the intense media attention to the case factored into sentencing because Turner was already suffering \"significant collateral consequences.\" He acknowledged that Turner, like the victim, was drunk, but added, \"I don’t attach very much weight to that\" in terms of leniency. In the end, Persky largely sided with Turner's family, including his mother, who wrote, “I beg of you, please don’t send him to jail/prison. Look at him. He won’t survive it,\" per the Los Angeles Times. About 1 million people have signed online petitions calling for Persky's ouster, but so far no formal paperwork has been filed toward a recall."}

{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– As horrific as yesterday's crash at an air race event in Reno was, witnesses say it could have been worse if not for last-second maneuvers by the veteran pilot. \"If he wouldn't have pulled up, he would have taken out the entire bleacher section,\" one dad there with his two daughters tells AP. \"I think he was trying to do whatever he could right up to the end,\" another tells CNN. \"I thought he was coming in on top of us. Instead, he missed us by about 100 feet and went out into the box area in front of us.\" As of this morning, three people were dead, including 74-year-old pilot Jimmy Leeward of Ocala, Fla. Early speculation is centering on mechanical failure. In a profile, the Los Angeles Times notes that Leeward—a real estate developer by trade—was a legend in the plane racing circuit and owned his own race team. He \"barreled through the skies in more than 120 competitions, and worked as a stunt pilot in several films. He was brawny and handsome; only some salt and peppering on his temples gave a hint of his 74 years.\" His Facebook page is collecting tributes, though the Times notes that some were questioning whether Leeward was too old for the circuit: \"What the hell was he doing up there over a public venue?\" (This blogger agrees.)"}
{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– The concept of temptation, and avoiding it, is something all Roman Catholics are made to confront throughout their liturgical lives. But Pope Francis is now saying if you feel that irresistible pull toward that which you shouldn't do, don't blame God for it. Specifically, per Reuters, the pontiff is taking issue with one line in the Lord's Prayer, aka the \"Our Father\"—the part in which worshipers implore God to \"lead us not into temptation.\" \"It is not a good translation, because it speaks of a God who induces temptation,\" the 80-year-old Francis told Italian broadcaster TV2000 on Wednesday, per the Guardian. \"I am the one who falls. It's not him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen. A father doesn't do that, a father helps you to get up immediately,\" he continued, blaming Satan instead for any transgressions. It's entirely possible something was lost in translation somewhere along the prayer's evolutionary timeline, as Reuters points out the original Aramaic was translated to ancient Greek, then to Latin, and finally to English. And the Telegraph notes translation errors and plain old typos have occurred over the years in related religious documents, such as the Bible (one famous one: leaving the word \"not\" out of the Seventh Commandment, leading it to read \"Thou shalt commit adultery\"). Francis pointed out that the Catholic Church in France has been using an alternative phrase in the Lord's Prayer, and it's one he's pushing for: \"Do not let us fall into temptation.\""}
{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– It isn't just talk of \"sexual fantasies\" and \"wet dreams\" that allegedly permeates Rep. Blake Farenthold's office. Though the Republican congressman from Texas has denied wrongdoing after paying $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim three years ago, two former aides tell the New York Times that Farenthold \"set the tone for off-color jokes and inappropriate banter\" that made discussions of women's breasts and male lobbyists' genitals commonplace. Elizabeth Peace, who served as Farenthold's press secretary until March, says she quit partly because of inappropriate sexualized comments, including discussions of strip clubs, photos of male lobbyists' genitals sent to female staffers, and conversations on which female reporters had breast implants. Per the Houston Chronicle, Peace complained about inappropriate sexualized comments in 2016, the same time another aide complained that female employees were treated \"differently\" in his office. A rep for Farenthold says a review found no evidence of wrongdoing and employees \"took sensitivity and anti-harassment training.\" Still, Peace says \"the behavior never changed,\" per the Times. An unnamed former aide who describes discussions of breasts also accuses Farenthold of \"rude comments\" and \"acts of aggression or rage.\" In response, the Texas Tribune notes the four-term congressman faces the toughest re-election fight of his career with Republican Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Barbara Comstock of Virginia demanding he resign. Most Republicans, however, appear to remain in Farenthold's corner."}
{"instruction": "What is a summary of the news article?", "answer": "– Black Sabbath called it a career Saturday night in the place where it all began 50 years earlier. Ozzy Osbourne and crew put on their final show for fans in Birmingham, England, concluding a legendary run with the band's first hit, \"Paranoid,\" reports the BBC. \"Thank you, good night, thank you so much,\" Osbourne said as they exited. He formed the band in 1968 with guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward, though Ward sat out the farewell tour in a financial dispute. \"I remember playing the Crown pub in Birmingham and thinking, 'This'll be good for a couple of years—drink a few beers and have a jam,'\" Osbourne said in a pre-show interview. AFP adds a nugget of rock trivia: Iommi lost the tips of two middle fingers as a 17-year-old sheet metal worker, then fashioned replacement tips out of melted plastic bottle tops. Out of necessity, he had to change his playing technique to make things easier, and that involved tuning his guitar lower. The resulting \"menacing\" music went a long way toward creating the heavy metal sound of the 1970s. Osbourne swears the band is done for good, and he's currently working on solo projects."}
