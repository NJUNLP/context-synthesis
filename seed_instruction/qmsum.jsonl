{"instruction": "What approaches were considered for the analysis?", "answer": "The group discussed the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of digits or Switchboard data. It was suggested that prior to the use of data-driven methods, knowledge-driven approaches should be used to 'seed' the data with sub-phonemic features, either manually, or using a rich pronunciation dictionary. A new version of the pre-segmentation tool that segments channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal has been developed and tested."}
{"instruction": "What was said in future work?", "answer": "An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation. Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions, which would trigger dialogues. Having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net. The possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further."}
{"instruction": "What were the preliminary recognition results?", "answer": "Preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data. The error rate distribution was multimodal, reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers, and also possible pre-processing errors. "}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the demand-driven approach in the programme.", "answer": "Janet Finch-Saunders believed that the Welsh and UK Governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents, so there was not a level playing field to start from. However, Julie Morgan insisted that some of their provision was universally available in certain areas. Hence historically that was definitely true of the programme. Then they were certainly planning to expand the programme, which is believed to be a demand-led approach. Last they were managing it within the normal budgetary process, developing a more integrated approach towards the early years, and had got the system of inspection to ensure that."}
{"instruction": "What did the team think about power cables?", "answer": "The team thought that a certain amount of rewiring was necessary to ensure a stable power supply. They also wanted to ensure that their equipment would not be plugged out. One way to solve this would be to build some sort of cabinet and collect the cables in one spot to avoid clutter."}
{"instruction": "Why did the group decide not to go for an LCD when discussing the remote concepts?", "answer": "When discussing the LCD functionality, the group found that it was not necessary to have it because they had the speaker and no need for a talk-back for the remote. Also, the LCD tended to be output as opposed to an input and it would be added to the cost of the remote, so the group agreed not to go for an LCD."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the evaluation process on the prototype.", "answer": "Every team member evaluated the prototype, and the evaluation criteria were user-oriented and market-indicated, which meant the product needed to meet the following standard such as fancy appearance, innovative technology, easy using, fashion in trend, being highly visible in a room, and robust quality. The marketing set up seven points in each criterion and let the team members to score the product from one to seven. It turned out every criterion of this prototype scored high, the evaluation results were quite satisfying."}
{"instruction": "Summarize Marketing's story and description of the butterfly she drew during the discussion of favourite animals.", "answer": "Marketing drew a butterfly because she had seen one the day before, which she considered as the symbol of spring arriving. It was the prettiest butterfly she had ever seen out in the wild, and this was quite unusual where they lived. Mistaking it as a dead leaf at first, she saw the butterfly land next to her, showing as colourful and exotica body as that of a peacock. Marketing appreciated her encounter with the butterfly very much."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion of the occurrence of \"spoon-feeding\" in post-16 education.", "answer": "Suzy Davies doubted that teachers might not pay enough attention to students' preparation for the baccalaureate and were prone to \"spoon-feed\". Kirsty Williams, however, pointed out that this was unlikely to happen, for different from the A-Levels which graded students under the particular syllabus of each subject, the baccalaureate evaluated the personal project and the ability of independent thinking."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the menu function and interaction with other tools of the remote control.", "answer": "Marketing tried to re-envision the remote control about the menu functionality, the current technology and the interaction with other tools based on the market research. Marketing suggested discarding unnecessary buttons and made a fancier remote control. They could also use the technology of speech recognition to help build the interaction."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about prioritizing remote control features?", "answer": "User Interface and Industrial designer expressed a desire to integrate cutting-edge features into the remote. Marketing pointed out that most of the market will buy it for standard use, like changing channels and adjusting volume, so those features should be the priority. Project Manager agreed, explaining that people expect a well-functioning, normal remote for their proposed product price of 25 Euros."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about remote control functional design?", "answer": "User Interface thought that changing channels is the basic function of the remote control, but can also be turned into a universal remote control. Based on the reality that the remote control is often lost in our life, he thought that they should add anti loss design into it. Marketing further proposed that tracking devices can be used, and Industrial Designer agreed that some beeps or vibrations can be added. Project Manager thought they needed to design a trendy, interesting and sturdy remote control."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about project finance and the new remote control design?", "answer": "Project Manager informed the team of their financial target, which was 50 million Euros. Each 25-Euro remote control would make a profit of 12.5 Euros. The team members had many ideas on the remote control design. User Interface recommended an integrating remote control for several different devices. Marketing spotted a niche in the game market and thus suggested adopting a bar-code design."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about the sample sensor?", "answer": "Marketing motioned for the idea of the sample sensor, which is something like a sample speaker, which has the function of voice recognition, and can help switch channels on hearing the direction of users. But this idea was abandoned because of unnecessity and expensiveness."}
{"instruction": "What did Cathy McLeod think of the forestry industry when talking about the uncertainty of Canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period?", "answer": "When talking about the uncertainty of Canadian economy and what the government should do, Cathy McLeod mentioned that the forestry industry even suffered depression before the outbreak of the COVID-19. The plants closed, and thousands of workers were unemployed. Meanwhile, both the art industry and fishery industry had received support from the government. Therefore, Cathy McLeod asked for more attention to the forestry to help them go through the difficulty. In response to her petition, ministers said that they did consider a lot of the solutions, including further investment and industrial revolution."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the first ideas they raised for the design of the remote.", "answer": "The aspects they mentioned were its compatibility, ergonomics, and the battery type it would use. Since the remote control was expected to be multifunctional, it must be compatible with all kinds of devices. This would also require a detailed instruction booklet for customers. The design of its look and curvature would also matter. Finally, the team agreed to keep the battery problem on hold."}
{"instruction": "Why does the industrial designer prefer a potential-meter for volume control?", "answer": "Users can't change the volume rapidly by using two discrete buttons for volume. While by using a potential-meter or a slider, the user can mute it down or make a high volume in one second."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the financing of the remote.", "answer": "Battery would be the energy source and the electronics would be regular chips on print. For the case, it would be double-curved and made from plastic in special colours, whereas buttons would come in different forms and colour and would be made in rubber or wood. In addition, there would be no clock. With the cost of eight twenty, the remote was within budget with the cost of voice recognizer excluded. Only four thirty euros was left to cover it so they would have to settle with what they get within the budget with no money for other special features."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about pricing and individual task assignment?", "answer": "Project Manager informed the team of the price issue and the financial goal. The unit price was determined to be 25 Euros. The production of each remote control would cost 12.5 Euros. The team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million Euros. Project Manager assigned individual tasks to the team members. Industrial Designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design. User Interface was supposed to specify the technical functions. Marketing would be responsible for market research."}
{"instruction": "What did Grad C think about the SPG schema?", "answer": "Grad C thought an approach in which the model had to refer to parents seemed inefficient. The model would constantly have to go back. Grad C wanted to completely redo it, even if it meant throwing away what the team had developed thus far."}
{"instruction": "What was Marketing's conclusion about the remote control watch trend?", "answer": "Marketing introduced watch trends in shapes, colours, material and functions from the past years. In Marketing's data, young people prefered fruity colours, round shapes and soft material. In contrast, elderly people liked dark colours, square shapes with round edges and hard material."}
{"instruction": "Why did the User Interface disagree with the Industrial Design when discussing their attempts to redesign the conceptual remote control because of the limited budget?", "answer": "When discussing how to control their budget, the Industrial Design put forward to use an integrating joystick or a scroll-wheel push-button like the mouse to reduce the number of the buttons on the remote control. It did sound great for that it allowed users to function the remote control by manipulating only one button as well as saved the cost for the group. However, according to the User Interface, actually it could cost even five times to design and produce an integrating button than just produce several scattered buttons, so this might not be a feasible suggestion."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about language training data for cell phones", "answer": "The team was gathering data from different languages and preparing relevant baselines. The professor reiterated that the multilingual focus was key since the reason for this project was to replace mel cepstra with a more robust, multilingual model. They needed sufficient diversity in the languages they used."}
{"instruction": "What changes did the group say were needed?", "answer": "The script for extracting speaker ID information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker."}
{"instruction": "What does the group think of the extent they'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils?", "answer": "Kirsty Williams thinks that it's absolutely crucial that we track performance. Where they weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. One of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt was the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. But they can't dictate a single system."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion on project logistics", "answer": "The team had pushed their code and was curious to know if the CVS system was working well. It was, at least from Belgium. Other team members needed to come back for the team to complete a few tasks."}
{"instruction": "What were the measures concerning the normal holiday provision for children?", "answer": "Kirsty admitted that they were now in a strange situation. What they were trying to work to was that they would have ongoing provision. Also, they were trying to create a system that would run uniformly. Such was a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale was something that they had not seen in 100 years. Therefore, they would have to evolve and iterate things as they went. Now they were worried about displacement activities. During the holidays, every head teacher would be in school on Monday with their staff."}
{"instruction": "What did working with local authorities actually mean?", "answer": "Kirsty Williams AM shared that the government were working closely with local authorities to understand what school had already done, for instance lending Chromebooks, iPads and laptops to children. Schools should make sure that students' access to current education patterns were available to all. Besides, nationwide purchase of digital learning tools, the government was also looking to purchase and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity on a national level. Last but not least, the government and local authorities were together continuing to identify education gap and decided to repurpose some of the resources which had been previously identified for the EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this particular gap."}
{"instruction": "What did postdoc A think about new headphones?", "answer": "Postdoc A thought that the original headphones had low gain, so he purchased new earphones. He informed the team that he just bought them from Cambridge SoundWorks down the street. They always have them in stock."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the team's discussion and evaluation of the whole production process.", "answer": "Industrial Designer first pointed out that they got stifled for creativity by the company restricting their product to only a TV remote. User Interface complained about having no whiteboard or Internet. Marketing thought they did a great job in general, having control over the actual design. Industrial Designer and User Interface were satisfied with their teamwork, while Project Manager also commented on them being a congenial team. Further complaints were made on the survey, yet they appreciated the digital pens, wireless laptops, a shared network, dual microphones and Big Brother. Many new ideas were also found through this process."}
{"instruction": "Summarize what their remote control would look like.", "answer": "Except uncertain problems such as LCD screen and speech recognition thing influenced by financial information, there would be many chances to have important buttons on top and bigger, different functional menus to adjust TV things, and very important idea of have replaceable covers, which could be designed to different colors meeting younger generation's demands."}
{"instruction": "What did Project Manager think of the incorporation of an LCD or a speech recognition system in the remote control?", "answer": "Marketing mentioned that most of the young people to thirty years old were interested in this kind of technology. However, Project Manager updated him and group mates that head offices would like to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations. Therefore, Project Manager suggested the group focusing more on the internet aspects because the teletext was outdated and it should be clear that the corporate image should be clearly identified in the product."}
{"instruction": "Why did Industrial Designer recommend the FPGA when talking about industrial working design?", "answer": "Industrial Designer said that FPGA was a field programmable gateway array. The Bluetooth chip was just responsible to make the communication between the two devices, but the FPGA was different. The FPGA would produce the data to send and it was for software."}
{"instruction": "What did the Professor say about the soldiers?", "answer": "The professor told the group a story about soldiers assigned to watch out for spy planes. The plane showed up at four each day and the soldiers called it in. Once the pattern was clear, they stopped looking for it and spent time with the locals instead. One day, the plane did not come but the soldiers still reported it, so they got into trouble. The professor used the story to make a point about making an assumption and then seeing if it holds after changing something small."}
{"instruction": "What did the professor think about latencies?", "answer": "The professor thought that the model was better now since it had lower latencies. So, he thought that the good VAD was worth the trouble."}
{"instruction": "Why did User Interface recommend a speech recognition interface when discussing the functions?", "answer": "User Interface thought that with a speech recognition interface, users were choosing the programmes directly instead of pressing the channel number. It was not costly and it was different technology and more powerful."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface think about colours and materials?", "answer": "User Interface suggested that the remote control could be made of plastics because it was the lightest and proposed that they could make the remote control different, maybe with face-plates."}
{"instruction": "Who did Marketing think the remote control should target and why?", "answer": "Marketing thought that remote control should be targeted at a low market. First, considering the tight budget, Marketing described the product as a cheap-end remote control, which would hardly gain the advantage over competitors in functionality. By saying that she implied that a high-end RC for a high market should be equipped with sophisticated functions, which were not possessed by a low-cost one anyway. Therefore, only a low market may want to buy it."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the role of Qualification Wales, according to Philip Blaker.", "answer": "Qualification Wales was the regulator of the awarding bodies, mainly focusing on the design of the qualifications and the delivery of the assessment. They were also responsible for maintaining standards, making sure that the grades people got were fair through comparable outcomes."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing recommend to do and why when discussing new useful features of the new remote control?", "answer": "Marketing recommended developing a multi-purpose remote control because most of the remote controls on the market were made just for one purpose. Besides, Marketing suggested to use some other technology, such as radio waves and bluetooth, than infrared because it could be easily affected by obstacles. Thirdly, a nice added feature was to inform users of the coming programmes. Marketing conceived a high-tech remote control to be competitive among other products."}
{"instruction": "Did Kirsty Williams' attitude towards the baccalaureate change after the discussion about universities' views on it?", "answer": "No, Kirsty Williams still showed confidence in the value of the baccalaureate. Despite the committee members' provision of contradictory evidence, he emphasized the importance of the communication with universities. Kirsty Williams believed that the baccalaureate was a beneficial endeavour for students to undertake before their entrance to the universities, rather than a detriment."}
{"instruction": "What were the reasons to thank the members of the Canadian Armed Forces?", "answer": "Ms. Anju Dhillon would like to thank the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for their invaluable assistance in the long-term care facilities. Since many seniors, the most vulnerable ones desperately needed them and they had offered great assistance."}
{"instruction": "How did the group discussed about the possible environmental-friendly material?", "answer": "The industrial designer suggested that when taking environmental impact into consideration, the product could switch to a more environmental-friendly material. This type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory, and it also allowed recycling. Hence, the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls. Even though the team liked the idea, the product manager also raised his concern towards the financial budget. In the end they agreed to discuss further about how they could achieve the idea by not exceeding the budget."}
{"instruction": "What was Sian Gwenllian's concern about the schools in the bottom layer?", "answer": "There were 12 percent of secondary schools under Estonian review and 11 percent of them were in special measures. He worried that these schools lacked enough support and fundings to adapt to the new curriculum reform and face greater difficulties."}
{"instruction": "How did the government plan to spread the method of building connections?", "answer": "Claire Morgan suggested that the first thing to do was to finish the inspection report, and the government should highlight the practice there. In this way, detailed outcomes of the methods would be listed and would be shared in the conferences where different schools join in it. But Hefin David AM challenged that it was not engaging and Claire Morgan argued that the learning process worthed trying."}
{"instruction": "Why did the Project Manager agree with the User Interface when discussing their presentations on the design, the functions and the target users of the remote control?", "answer": "The User Interface put forward to add an extra function to the remote control to make it be able to hide some features and display a clear menu. The Project Manager was in favor of this design for that it would be easy to find those really essential functions on the menu more easily."}
{"instruction": "What did the Marketing think of the external design of the remote control when discussing the material and function issue of it?", "answer": "When the group was talking about the material and function issue, the Marketing laid stress on the innovation for that they already had to drop several advanced techniques to meet the budget limitation and it was necessary for them to find something unique.He pointed out that they could take the advantage of the fruit and vegetable logos on the remote control, as well as the primary colors of the button."}
{"instruction": "What is the progressing condition of the Schools Challenge Cymru?", "answer": "Some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools are making sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. Like the example of Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. The challenge is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and they haven't seen the progress of how to use the school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools . So now the focus is a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support. Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have."}
{"instruction": "What did Industrial Designer propose when discussing the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser when discussing specific details connected with market interests?", "answer": "Industrial Designer proposed that the team could have just numbers for channels and the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between different voices and deal with noises."}
{"instruction": "What's the decision of the discussion about the issues with HMRC?", "answer": "Jo-Anne Daniels finally came to the conclusion that they could deliver a cheaper system with flexibility that the Deputy Minister had referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. At the moment, the extra cost would be about £2.5 million, which according to their initial estimate suggested that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC."}
{"instruction": "What was the way to get families and the community more involved in education?", "answer": "John Griffiths AM suggested that one way was through community-focused schools that were very much accessible to the community, linked well with outside organisations, having an extended school-day offer. Meilyr Rowlands agreed that it was a good method and the government was delighted to support the remaining schools which still participate in the process in every way. It was concluded that a new mechanism should be added to avoid misunderstanding the role of community-focused schools."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about looked-after children and transitional-arrangement.", "answer": "Carol Shillabeer answered a question from Suzy Davies, indicating the intersection between the Together for Children and Young People programme and the Outcomes for Children Group programme. Next, in response to Dawn Bowden, Shillabeer talked about the development of transition guidance and the endeavor to reduce the numbers of transitions and manage them better."}
{"instruction": "What did the group talk about the material and function issue and a questionnaire?", "answer": "As to have a clear idea about what they had already got, the Project Manager proposed to evaluate finished work first. Then through the review, they found the problem that the joystick might not function as well as they thought before. In addition, in order to keep it innovative, the group decided to add some unique things like fruit logos or make it in a three-D shape. According to the User Interface, they should put the electronics into fashions so the material also needed some discussion. Plastics and rubber were both fine to them for that they were not easy to be destroyed and favored by most youths. After all the discussions, the Marketing offered a questionnaire for them to check whether they made the right decisions."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think about the merits of speech recognition inclusion?", "answer": "Marketing agreed that speech recognition gets old and is a gimmick. Marketing also thought that since younger people are not the consumers spending money on remotes their preference for speech recognition might not matter greatly."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the recap of the last meeting.", "answer": "The general idea for the remote was that it should be easy to use, attractive and electricity saving. People might lose it a lot and it could be sold by using a slogan. For the technical aspect, the remote should have a chip with an interface that controls it, infrared bulbs, battery, wires, buttons and holder. There should be extra features such as timer, lid buttons, on-off button, channel lock and display clock. The remote could be in different shapes, preferably compact and T-shaped. The material should be of non-allergic nature. The different systems that exist were infrared and radio-waves."}
{"instruction": "What do the group think of the question whether the eligibility for free school meals is the best measure?", "answer": "According to Kirsty Williams, it's probably the best that they've got at present, and will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways.  Officials are working all the time in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that."}
{"instruction": "What did the professor think about speech rate algorithms?", "answer": "The professor thought it mattered how fast someone was speaking since the model was getting a spectrum over different kinds of speech sounds. He was skeptical that changing speech rate was the solution, though he thought it was worth looking into. His solution was collecting more samplings of different phones for when people speak slower."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the group discussion about the functional design.", "answer": "The group agreed that the remote should be fancy and easy to be hand-held. It should not be too small or too big in good shape. They agreed to bring new technologies and push toward the internet for young peoples. So they would use the wheel to navigate. Also regarding the budget, they had a new target price but it would be impossible to have LCD and automatic speech recognition technologies implementation."}
{"instruction": "What was the main idea of User Interface when talking about the functions and why?", "answer": "User Interface thought there should be a function, instead of choosing the TV channel, users could choose TV channels or the contents of the programme. It was more powerful. Some of the websites already provide this service so this technology is also available."}
{"instruction": "What did people say about what caused the raising of the number of the looked-after children when talking about the unintended consequences?", "answer": "There were many reasons that had led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales, and it was hard to identify a single reason. Increased austerity was a part of this. In addition, an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of domestic abuse also affected this. It was also because of our understanding of what happened to children in those households. Besides, changes in our practice with colleagues in the judiciary, changes in the police service, and changes in the preventative services were other elements."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about evaluation, investment and responsibility of the draft strategy.", "answer": "There was no exact evaluation but Dr Frank Atherton did think they should have a strong one. The draft strategy also made an estimate in investment which would be £8 million to £10 million a year. Investment would be spent on different sources and they should pay more attention to extending them. Speaking of leadership, Dr Frank Atherton agreed to its importance and made his own opinion that local leadership was essential and they should also have national oversight at the same time."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface suggest about the shape of the button when discussing the design of the remote?", "answer": "User Interface believed that fancy buttons might create lots of trouble for people to use the remote. So, he suggested that there could be only one fancy button. For example, the stand by button could be shaped like an apple, and all the other buttons could only stay in normal shape."}
{"instruction": "What features of the remote control did Marketing think were important?", "answer": "Marketing thought that making the remote look cool and modern was important. Marketing also thought that many buttons could be removed or combined. Marketing also thought a tracking device and speech recognition could be good ideas."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about neurodevelopmental service.", "answer": "In terms of an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, Hefin David wanted to know its reasons and measures. Carol Shillabeer responded with no specific idea for the reasons and an introduction of delivery progression for the measures. Being asked, Carol then talked about a broader view of group work, mentioning the limitation of threshold and focused conditions."}
{"instruction": "What did the Marketing think about previous remote controls when giving his presentation on the design,the functions and the target users?", "answer": "As per his research, the Marketing found that the existing remote controls were not satisfactory in terms of their appearance and feel. In addition, some remote controls were not easy to find and very hard to master. What was also worth mentioning was that some details like the brightness of the screen and the colors needed improvement as well."}
{"instruction": "What was said about the deadline?", "answer": "There is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to Eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded."}
{"instruction": "What's the conclusion of the discussion about differences of care provision in different parts of Wales?", "answer": "The team was aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education. And with the Flying Start programme being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities, they knew that there was a variance throughout Wales. Next some of their care provision was universally available in certain areas. Then historically, that was definitely true, and they were certainly planning to expand it, developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. Finally they had got the system of inspection to ensure that."}
{"instruction": "What did the team agree about lighting adaptive options when talking about the presentation which linked the project with market interests?", "answer": "Lighting adaptive was a little bit complex. It was possible but not in this project."}
{"instruction": "What solution was proposed for the transcribers?", "answer": "Transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process."}
{"instruction": "What did the professor think about improving voice-unvoice detection?", "answer": "The professor explained that the task typically relied on R-one over R-zero as a measure. He thought that the team should explore the difference between the log FFT and the log magnitude FF spectrum and the filter bank. These were fundamentally different measures which could help the model."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion on support vector machines to map MFCC to phonological features", "answer": "Support vector machines were better at dealing with a lower amount of data, so they could do a reasonable job learning patterns in MFCC without too much work. They worked by finding an optimal separating plane. This was more efficient as the model picked only critical points as opposed to doing more computationally expensive k-means clustering."}
{"instruction": "What were the components discussed during the presentation of the component design that were required for the construction of the remote control?", "answer": "There should be a strong and recyclable case that was not made from harmful materials such as plastic. A resistor, capacitor, diode, transistor, circuit board and resonator should be in the remote, along with a timer and alarm facility. The integrated circuit could be highly sophisticated for higher efficiency and should be resistant to high and low temperatures. Also, colouring components could be used if the remote was to have different colours. For the battery, it could be rechargeable as people can use it for a long time and saves costs for production."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the decision of the discussion on the name chosen of the product.", "answer": "They agreed to cross out 'banana remote', 'the deluxe' from the options. They all agreed on the 'triple R' without arguments, because the group thought it looked cool when it was printed out. In addition, it was short and catchy."}
{"instruction": "Did Marketing and User Interface agree on desired features?", "answer": "Marketing and User Interface agreed on the importance of fewer buttons for a user-centered remote. Marketing and User Interface also agreed on the importance of the appearance of a remote control."}
{"instruction": "What did the team think of Marketing's proposal of Bluetooth?", "answer": "Marketing thought that Bluetooth is a fancy function that may attract customers.  However, Project Manager reckoned that the Bluetooth function means that users  need a television that has Bluetooth function. Televisions rarely have this function. Marketing thought that it would be a new trend and they need to move away from what they already had and go creative. But after all the proposal of Bluetooth was suspended."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the energy source.", "answer": "The group rejected the idea of wind-up because it wasn't suitable for the theme of the remote control, and the idea of solar power because it was inconvenient to use in darkness. Industrial Designer suggested using the kinetic as the source of power. This opinion was accepted by the group because of its convenience, light weight, fancy design and the good selling point of the environment."}
{"instruction": "What did Industrial Designer think of the look of the product when discussing the evaluation of the prototype.", "answer": "Industrial Designer thought it was fancy because the product had a single curve and the material of the rubber was fashionable at that time."}
{"instruction": "How would special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement?", "answer": "Already, local authorities were making different provisions. Even in special schools, there would be children whose parents would be key workers. Therefore, they would expect them to expect those sChools to apply the same principle. They would have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school. Thus, they would look to cater for that within the original school."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about acoustic events", "answer": "Grad A explained that he was trying to collect a set of acoustic events to help distinguish between various linguistic features. The team distinguished between acoustic features and acoustic events. Acoustic events were a feature of the acoustic signal that could be derived from the data."}
{"instruction": "What details did Industrial Designer give when introducing remote control prototype?", "answer": "The remote control would be moulded to the shape of the hand when people held it. On the left there was a slider for the volume, and on the right there were several buttons. The power key would be the biggest so that people knew how to turn on the television. There would also be a microphone for all the voice commands."}
{"instruction": "What did Project Manager and Industrial Designer discuss about making an universal remote control?", "answer": "Their remote control could be purchased in a situation when users' old remote had broken, so a universal remote control could be a must. Project Manager put forward this idea but did not know if there would be any chance to accomplish it easily, and Industrial Designer it would be possible but still needed some research."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discuss about user requirements of the new remote control?", "answer": "Marketing presented the user requirements. The market research results were from 100 people. It frustrated users most when they failed to find the lost remote control. The market research also revealed a necessity to simplify the remote control interface, for users would not take time mastering the remote control. Most buttons were thus unused, and teletext was outdated now. Besides, Marketing expressed a negative view on the incorporation of voice recognition."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about introduction of petitions and prioritization of government matters.", "answer": "The Chair brought the meeting to order, announcing that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss COVID-19 's impact on Canada. Five petitions were presented: to recognize indeginous languages as official languages of Canada, to improve the organ donation system, to push for a made-in-Canada green economy, to decriminalize drug possession to improve public health, and to protect firearm ownership of law-abiding firearm owners. Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus suggested that the government should not try to pass gun-control legislation or release prisoners during the pandemic. The Prime Minister disagreed, claiming that both passing gun-control and releasing imprisoned Canadians who did not pose a threat to society advanced the safety of Canadians."}
{"instruction": "What did the lab tests tell them about the design of buttons?", "answer": "According to the lab tests, users only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote. It was shown that users didn't really need all the buttons provided by current remotes, and it would be more user-friendly if their new remote could lose the unnecessary ones. The most frequently used buttons were those for the channel, the volume and the power on/off."}
{"instruction": "What was the decision of the discussion about button design?", "answer": "Though Project Manager brought up scroll button and joystick as possible options, Industrial rejected that idea by arguing that the elderly were not accustomed to using them, therefore basic layout would be sufficient. Then Marketing further pointed out that there was not so much to gain in the competition of less buttons, as very few buttons would be needed for a TV remote anyway. Project Manager accepted those ideas."}
{"instruction": "What did Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish think about the relationship with other agencies when talking about relative agencies and workload?", "answer": "Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish thought it was really important for agencies, like social services, the police, MASHs to work together in a consistent and appropriate way. However, the team was not dependent on others' work, considering not every area would get their help."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface recommend to do when discussing the functional design and why?", "answer": "User Interface recommended to design a power cradle for the controller so that it would be unnecessary to change batteries. In this way, users would always know where the remote was because they had to put the device back to the cradle to charge it, which addressed the problem of losing it. This attempt would also do good to the look and feel of the remote control as a whole. The idea would be considered by the group, but they had to look into how much this might increase the cost."}
{"instruction": "What did the team discuss about the product cost?", "answer": "Firstly, using kinetic was quite a large expense at three Euros. Secondly, in terms of the material used on the device, the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic to cut costs with one color for the case and one color for the buttons. Moreover, the push button interface was inexpensive so the team agreed to add a special form for the case. Lastly, ssthe team did not choose joystick, LED display or advanced chips, they were able to make the budget under control."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the group discussion about the turbo button when discussing the scroll wheel.", "answer": "User Interface suggested including the turbo button in scroll wheels and introduced that the turbo button was like a scroll wheel to scroll the past television stations without seeing what's on them. Marketing asked about the speed whether it could be controlled. User Interface explained that users could skip over channels and know it was going fast or whatever. User Interface also suggested switch on and off buttons. Project Manager agreed to add one switch on button."}
{"instruction": "What was the idea of personalization and how was it not so feasible?", "answer": "The marketing specialist threw out the idea of making the remote control cover changeable and personalized. The marketing specialist further suggested that they could incorporate the TV theme elements such as Bart Simpson into the cover. However, it might raise a question about copyright issues so they decided to delay the discussion."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think about functional requirements about remote control?", "answer": "According to data, Marketing thought that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screen and speech recognition. However, older people didn't care about features so much and spent more money on remote control than younger people. Findings also showed that fifty percent of users lost remote control so bigger is better than smaller about remote control. Marketing expressed that volume button and channel button were the most important buttons so they should be found easily."}
{"instruction": "What additional assignments were proposed about the digits?", "answer": "Future work may involve experimenting with the reading of digits in different prosodic groupings."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the group discussion about the target group and corresponding functionalities.", "answer": "When Projected Manager announced that the group should decide on the target group, Marketing thought that with a tight budget, the functionality of the product would be greatly restricted. Hence, only a low market could be reached. However, after a brief discussion about LCR screen, Project Manager brought back the idea of universal remote control, and the group reached a consensus on the feasibility of designing a basic universal remote control at a low cost."}
{"instruction": "What did Andrew Clark think of the inconsistency with how admission offers were made concerning the skill challenge certificates?", "answer": "Andrew Clark thought the inconsistency reflected the different ways that universities treat the skill challenge certificates and the baccalaureate, whose prime focus was individual ability. He added that the universities' attitudes had changed significantly since there was a graded qualification, for even those who did not make the baccalaureate part of their offer considered it a valuable sign that young people were prepared to go to university."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface think of the easy-to-learn design of remote controls when discussing the technical design?", "answer": "User Interface proposed a paradox here. On the one hand, being simple and easy to use might be achieved at the price of losing individuality; on the other hand, being individual unavoidably meant that everybody must learn to use it first."}
{"instruction": "What did the team say about the project and overall process?", "answer": "The team thought they had a really great team work experience. Everyone had put efforts into the process and gave opinions to design a good remote control. Also, the process incorporated different stages and new ideas could always be added based on the market finds."}
{"instruction": "What did the professor think about acoustic events?", "answer": "The professor recalled that the SPAM work had something similar to acoustic events, auditory events. He also informed the team that Professors Kollmeier and Professor Kleinschmidt will be visiting for six months, and they may know more about this topic."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface recommend to do when discussing features to make the remote control trendy and why?", "answer": "When discussing features to make the remote control trendy, User Interface recommended to keep the remote control simple in order to gain a whole market and to use a standard as it was aimed at an international market."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think of technology innovation when presenting the market trend?", "answer": "Marketing mentioned that market research emphasized technology innovation which was the ease of use in the functionality. So Marketing suggested when they focused on the trend of fruit and vegetable themes, they should know how to fit in with something which was not specifically electronics and how to quickly create a remote in fruit shape."}
{"instruction": "What was the decision of the discussion of the chip?", "answer": "The group selected the regular-style chip without the LCD display. It only had simple push buttons except for a more advanced one for the interior lighting system."}
{"instruction": "What did the PhD F think about Eurospeech?", "answer": "PhD F explained that they were trying to do something with meeting recorder digits for Eurospeech. Some people on OGI were working on a paper due on the 13th of May."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the group discussion about the general specification.", "answer": "The group agreed to target 15 to 25 year olds. They decided to make the remote look simple, but have the key buttons to make it easy to use. Also, groupmates agreed to use one menu button and they would include voice recognition as one option."}
{"instruction": "What did the group plan to discuss for the next meeting?", "answer": "Project Manager gave each team member different tasks. Project Manager asked Industrial Designer to look at the working design, User Interface to work on the technical functions and Marketing to be responsible for user requirements. User Interface recommended to achieve some agreement on whether to use the new remote control for multiple systems, and User Interface also asked whether to use a text screen or bluetooth. Besides, Project Manager also demanded that everyone in the group should individually ponder the most important thing in this project from their own perspective."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about changes in the current design.", "answer": "User Interface indicated to have a simple LCD screen to cut down the budget, while Industrial Designer suggested the application of a little more complex LCD panel, like the number pad, could display the advanced functions possibly used by the users. Marketing and Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer. Next, the group turned to discuss some details, like the total size for the button, and the various functions of the button as well as a jog-dial."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface think about the design of the remote control when discussing the user interface concept?", "answer": "User Interface suggested a simple interface with a few scroll wheels on it, but User Interface also appreciated the idea of chunky plastic remote control with big buttons, which was simple, easy to use and cost effective."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the presentation about findings for marketing.", "answer": "People liked something that fit their hand and fewer buttons which the functions were obvious. They didn't want to squint at small prints and didn't care for different modes. The appearance of the remote should be eye-catching and appealing. The remote had to be in the market before competition for Christmas. Fruit and vegetable shapes were very popular this year and people were back into a soft and spongy feel with a little cloth. The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two and voice recognizer could be an option."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the evaluation of the marketing expert on the prototype using the past user requirements and trends analysis.", "answer": "The marketing expert confirmed with the group that the product was aimed at people with age below forty, but it  was also designed for people above forty. The marketing expert also stated that people would need a teletext button because it was originally combined with the menu in the prototype. After that, the marketing expert discussed with the designers to design the prototype with fresh colours so it would be more discoverable when lost. They also agreed on the button numbers and the texture."}
{"instruction": "What was the discussion about the jog dial's function when talking about changes in the current design?", "answer": "The jog dial can be used to control volume, contrast, brightness, channels, auxiliary inputs, color, sharpness, sound, audio, left-right balance, and pre-programmed sound modes."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion on Eurospeech and reverberation", "answer": "Eurospeech was taking place in Denmark and the team was planning on submitting a paper to it. The team was also discussing how to best present the reverberation problem. The team thought that the spectral effects of the reverberation were very clear. They would have to figure out how to remove the sources of variance from the data to capture only the main voice."}
{"instruction": "What aspects did the team like when evaluating the whole production process?", "answer": "Marketing commented on the overall process as fairly satisfying, since they had control over most of the detailed design of the remote, how it should be advanced as well as fashionable. As for teamwork, Industrial Designer and User Interface thought they worked well together, and Project Manager praised the team for being congenial. They also appreciated many things that were available to them, including digital pens, wireless laptops, a shared network, dual microphones, and Big Brother. They agreed that many new ideas were developed as well."}
{"instruction": "What did the team think of the locking function when discussing User Interface's presentation on the layout of the remote control?", "answer": "User Interface said the locking function is a novel idea and a good inspiration. He had never seen a locking functionality. But User Interface thought that the locking function might be unnecessary, while Project Manager thought it probably should be easy to be realized in a physical form like a cover, a switch or a flip thing."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the marketing target of the remote control.", "answer": "The preliminary aim of the profit was fifty million Euros. The setting price was twenty-five Euros each remote control, and therefore the profit was twelve and a half Euros per item. To reach the profit goal of fifty million, Marketing set a sales figure of four million."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the specific questions and answers on the impact on education.", "answer": "There were totally two questions proposed on impact on education. First, Jayne Bryant asked how confident they were that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill. Alastair Birch responded that training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear. The awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there. The second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust. Alastair Birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust. He thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child, they were under a duty to report that to social care."}
{"instruction": "What should be expected from reviewing the role of the middle tier?", "answer": "Steve believed that it was set up to build collective efficacy because what people out there were seeing was a confusion of roles in what the regions were doing, and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel. They would have collective effort, but they needed to do more within the middle tier."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think of potential cost pressure incurred by the application of battery status display?", "answer": "When Marketing mentioned the application battery status display, he added that it could possibly drag up the production cost and that further research would be carried out before decision-making. But still, he implied that he wanted it to be applied if possible."}
{"instruction": "How did the group hold their views towards multi-functional and single-functional product?", "answer": "The user interface designer suggested two options of making the remote control functional. One way was to make it multi-functional, so as to be used for several entertainment devices. Another way was to make it single-functional, which could be used specifically for the television. The entire group preferred the product to be single-functional. It is because making an original design was more obtainable, and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic. They had to make it compatible with different brands of devices to sell internationally."}
{"instruction": "According to Philip Blaker, who should be responsible for developing the curriculum resources?", "answer": "Philip Blaker thought it needed to be determined. But he also believed that Welsh Government had a role in curriculum at that moment, so Welsh Government had responsibility for the curriculum and drew people together to look at the new model for the future."}
{"instruction": "During process evaluation, why did not Marketing agree that the meeting process was moving along the right phases?", "answer": "When it came to processing evaluation, though Industrial Designer appeared to think highly of Project Manager's arrangements, Marketing clearly voiced his dissent. as he explained, it is obvious that financial issues were touched on too late, making it imperative to further adjust to the final design during budget control. Project Manager himself admitted that there existed a lack of information about prices, which in fact led to a number of unrealistic dialogues about costly functions like recognition."}
{"instruction": "What was the advantage of \"triple R\" compared to \"triple RC\" when discussing the name chosen of the product?", "answer": "\"Triple RC\" made the product look like a triple remote control, but it was only a single remote control. In addition, the important part was triple R anyway, Real Reaction Remote. Therefore, they decided to drop C from this name, and just keep \"triple R\"."}
{"instruction": "What did Hon. Chrystia Freeland think about systemic racism?", "answer": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland stated that there had existed racism in Canada. Systemic racism had existed in all federal institutions, including the RCMP."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think of repetitive strain injury when discussing functional requirements?", "answer": "Marketing was asking what RSI was when mentioning the user needs to be easy to use. User Interface answered that it was repetitive strain injury. So Marketing denied this function because it did not match people's operating behaviour and users wanted a remote control with fewer buttons which would be easy to learn. Just like the audio setting was not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often."}
{"instruction": "What ideas did Industrial Designer suggest when discussing market research and related adjustments?", "answer": "Industrial Designer believed that the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system. The remote control needed an energy source to supply power to the integrated circuit, and had a chip and related information to control the infrared lamp. In the design, it can make the battery and infrared lamp cheaper and more sustainable. It can also add the design of speech recognition interface according to the market research provided by Marketing."}
{"instruction": "Summarize user interface's opinions towards radio wave interference.", "answer": "User interface said that they could make this wave in specific frequency to avoid interfering with other devices. A password could also be put inside the wave in case that two neighbours had the same remote controls. If two devices were trying to go to communicate with the TV set, then the wave with more energy was chosen."}
{"instruction": "What did the team agree about kinetic battery when talking about the components concept of industrial design?", "answer": "The team could choose from the basic battery, kinetic battery and solar energy. Solar energy would not work in a cluttered environment. Kinetic battery was the one people could recharge by themselves. The team would find out if the kinetic metal was sufficient to provide enough energy."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about schools causing concern with questions from Irranca-Davies.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, there were a variety of ways in which schools that needed support or needed to be challenged on their practice would be identified. Basically, they relied on the school categorization system. What's more, in Kirsty's opinion, the school improvement service was a risk-based approach. Luckily, the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation. It would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards. What they needed now was a more strategic, longer term approach to reach changes in a school rather than some of the easy-to-fix items that made a school as if it was doing better."}
{"instruction": "What did the PDG come into working with families?", "answer": "Claire Morgan first suggested that in the best schools, the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers, and they often set up arrangements where they engaged directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who were under achieving generally. And PDG would be used for appointing staff to these positions to connect the family with the school."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the questioning about the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns and N95 masks.", "answer": "Since the government cancelled contracts with companies that were not able to meet Canadian standards, the member highlighted that it should be supporting more local companies for production. The minister answered that the government had been running multiple complementary supply chains at the same time, and were signing contracts with few more domestic companies. However, the opposition party was skeptical about those companies and other possible companies receiving sufficient funds for production."}
{"instruction": "What did the conferees think of the solution to water-proof and shock-proof technical demands when discussing the designing requirements of the new remote control?", "answer": "Conferees agreed that the remote control could be sold with optional plastic protection and water-proof box for customers to choose."}
{"instruction": "Summarize Project Manager's opinions towards the idea of a programmable remote control when discussing details on the new remote control style and the plan for the next meeting.", "answer": "Marketing did not understand the purpose of a programmable remote control. Project Manager agreed with User Interface on that if users used the remote control for different devices, they would need to program particular commands into codes on the remote control. Project Manager added that users could even make the remote control perform a specific function by looking up the function name produced by themselves, instead of looking for the command code on the computer."}
{"instruction": "What were their opinions on support or changes of circumstances?", "answer": "Actually, they did not anticipate any change in the approach to students. Individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. There would undoubtedly in some cases be really typical challenges to service delivery, simply because organizations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they were reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. They instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions had campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease had progressed, they had seen lessons being learned from the support for students who were in isolation coming from there to the UK."}
{"instruction": "Why did the team couldn't think of the satisfying size of the new TV remote controls?", "answer": "Industrial Designer pointed out that too many buttons would get the remote controls too big and clunky. However, a really small and slim one was very likely to be lost. The User Interface then proposed a PDA or hand-held kind of remote controls. Unfortunately, it was not friendly to the unit price."}
{"instruction": "What did Carol Shillabeer find unexpected when talking about neurodevelopmental service?", "answer": "There would be only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of families met a threshold for the support, while more people still needed help. Therefore, focusing on the families who reached a threshold is not good enough, and the programme should tackle all of them."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the general functionalities of the new product.", "answer": "User Interface presented a general layout of remote control functionalities. The ergonomic shape of the remote control could raise product customizability. User Interface proposed to incorporate a flip screen and to add a LCD light to show battery life. User Interface also gave suggestions on possible positioning of the key pad. To summarize, User Interface preferred the design to be simple and clear."}
{"instruction": "What was the proposed structure of the belief net.", "answer": "The team discussed that the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete, although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet. These nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system. Their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction, or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user."}
{"instruction": "What's the conclusion of the discussion about battery versus kinetic when presenting on components?", "answer": "Industrial Designer asked about whether group mates choose battery or kinetic. User Interface suggested that they could use the kinetic as a back-up. Marketing supplemented that it could be a combination. So, Industrial Designer concluded that they could use the battery and charge it up with kinetic. Group mates agreed on it."}
{"instruction": "What did Project Manager think as the main frustrations of designing the remote control when discussing the technical design?", "answer": "Project Manager considered easy-to-use and easy-to-find as the two main frustrations in designing remote controls. But at the same time, such frustrations may pronounce a serious competitive advantage for the project without making too complex stuff or using too much time to develop."}
{"instruction": "What other points did the product manager and the marketing specialist raise about functions of the product?", "answer": "The marketing specialist suggested a LCD screen could be installed. The industrial designer thought it would be good to link with the teletext function. Also, the marketing specialist raised points about the target age group. In their assumption, a teenager would not be willing to pay for an expensive remote control, whereas the elder age group would be more willing. The group reached a consensus on catering the product to the age group of early twenties."}
{"instruction": "What did the team say about the project and overall process?", "answer": "The team thought that the project manager showed good leadership and that was a must during the teamwork process. Besides, they had a really great project design experience and everyone had put efforts into the process and gave opinions to design a good remote control. After all, they have learned a lot from each other as well as the overall customers' tastes within the industry."}
{"instruction": "What did Grad D think about the tax return?", "answer": "Grad D thought that his tax returns were taking too much time. He had started writing code for his work, however. He was expecting that his taxes would be easier next year, since he would not have to declare his Canadian income."}
{"instruction": "What did the user interface designer and the project manager discuss about the colour of the product?", "answer": "The user interface designer was trying to implement a more dynamic and youthful colour on the remote control. However, the designers did not want it to be too childish and stated their will to make it more of an adult-style. Thus they wanted to use metallic grey as the colour of the appearance, and make an extra cover with flashy fruity colours to attract the broader public. Since their target aim was still younger people, a cover would make them more flexible to change the remote control into whatever colour they wanted."}
{"instruction": "What did the group talk about the uncertainty of Canadian economy and what the government should do during the special period?", "answer": "Justin Trudeau was confident about the economic recovery after the pandemic, however, Cathy McLeod and Mona Fortier and some other members did not agree with him for that they thought Canada was undergoing an extreme uncertain time during which no one could foresee a bright future unless the prime minister kept the revenue report public. Furthermore, statistics showed that actually Canada had suffered decline in revenue in both the first and second season this year, and the forestry industry even reported depression before the outbreak. Various evidence showed a great challenge to the Canadian economy."}
{"instruction": "Describe the whole discussion concerning Project Manager's favourite animal in the team building process.", "answer": "First, Project Manager announced that her favourite animal at the time was an elk. User Interface immediately joked that it looked vicious, what with the big antlers. Industrial Designer then asked whether everyone had elk where they came from. The team then complimented Project Manager's drawing for the elk. Project Manager consequently gave her reasons for choosing the elk as her favourite, saying it was a large beautiful majestic creature that could overcome harsh terrain and defend itself. She considered that even though elks would appear awkward, they were actually very gorgeous animals."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the conclusion of experiments and questionnaire for user requirement.", "answer": "Users didn't like the look and feel of most remote controls currently on the market. And most users only used ten percent of buttons on the remote control. Channel selection button was the most commonly used button, followed by the volume button. Young users might prefer to have high technology features such as LCD display or speech recognition function on the remote control."}
{"instruction": "What was discussed about contextualizing output?", "answer": "Due to most outputs not being relevant to the given context, they will either have to be pruned a posteriori, or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion. The latter option could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms. In any case, on what basis the \"winner\" output is chosen is not clear."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the group's attempts to redesign the conceptual remote control because of the limited budget.", "answer": "According to the Project Manager, the group had gone far beyond the budget, so they had to cut down something on the current conceptual remote design. The first idea they came up with was to reduce the number of the buttons. The Industrial Design proposed to use an integrating button to replace the scattered ones, but inevitably, this also had some defects. The User Interface focused on the material and he put forward to choose a cheaper material like wood or plastics. Paying attention to the energy consumption, the Marketing suggested using a hand dynamo to save the cost of batteries."}
{"instruction": "Summarize what was said about digits form", "answer": "Digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers. A tentative decision was made to collect overlapping digits from speakers."}
{"instruction": "What was the structure of the Bayes-net discussed.", "answer": "The input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models, feeds into a set of decision nodes, such as the Enter/View/Approach (EVA) endpoint. In any particular situation, most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context. Therefore, they will either have to be pruned a posteriori, or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion."}
{"instruction": "What ideas did User Interface suggest when discussing market research and related adjustments?", "answer": "User Interface advocated to adjust to meet the needs of users from the perspective of technical function design. It is mainly user-centred, reducing buttons and making it easier to use. In addition, User Interface suggested that the general remote controller proposed by marketing will increase the budget and button, so the research should be stopped and focused on the remote control's appearance design."}
{"instruction": "What did the team discuss about the Wall Street Journal data?", "answer": "PhD E informed the team that Guenter was putting the Wall Street Journal data on the team's disks. There was a lot of data so it would take some time to run the models."}
{"instruction": "What did the team discuss about the design of the remote control and what is the conclusion of the discussion?", "answer": "The team discussed the material of the remote and the shape of the buttons. They finally made the decision that the case and buttons of the remote should be made of rubber, and the shape of buttons should be as simple as possible."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about User Interface design about remote control.", "answer": "User Interface designed position of normal and usual buttons such as plus, minus, sound and program. Project Manager suggested the microphone was a special point so it should be placed visibly. Then User Interface decided to put the microphone in a company logo. Marketing thought scroll was convenient, Industrial Designer agreed and designed scroll on the side. Project Manager thought remote control would be fancier with scroll."}
{"instruction": "What detailed suggestions did Industrial Designer put forward when discussing the specific shape design of remote control?", "answer": "Industrial Designer proposed to design mouse-like click function and the scrolling function which is the simplest in technology. In addition, some small protuberances can be designed under the remote control, which is more convenient for users from the perspective of ergonomics, and the battery can be installed from the engineering point of view. He also proposed a two in one remote control. The small remote control has simple basic functions and is easy to carry. The large remote control is not easy to lose when it is fixed on furniture such as a sofa or table."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about ideas about timescales for setting out what approach would be to handling the lack of exams.", "answer": "Kirsty believed that it was a devastating decision to have been taken. But they had done so on the very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. They were dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. Therefore, their best attempts would be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exam's day in August, but that had to be caveated by the fact that they were dealing with difficult circumstances. With regard to AS-levels, no final decision has been made for exactly how those students would be treated. There were a range of options that could be used. With regard to other types of qualifications, the vast majority of BTECs was a modular continually-assessed piece of work, and they would have every expectation that BTECs would be able to be awarded."}
{"instruction": "What did Marketing think about the menu functionality when discussing the menu function and interaction with other tools of the remote control?", "answer": "Marketing held the opinion that they had to make some change on the button. According to the market research, fifty percent of users dislike the current look and feel of remote control, and only use ten percent of the buttons. More importantly, eighty percent would spend more money on a fancy remote control. The research showed that it was the time to discard some unnecessary buttons and made it fancier."}
{"instruction": "Why did the group discard voice recognition function?", "answer": "Marketing first brought up price concern, implying that voice recognition could significantly drive up cost and price. Also, Marketing argued that unlike the LCD screen, the elderly would not fancy speech recognition because it would not make the remote control more user-friendly. Project Manager applauded Marketing's opinion and agreed that the LCD screen should be given priority over voice recognition."}
{"instruction": "What is the problem concerning feasibility?", "answer": "Project Manager had an idea of the insertion of LCD display screen on the remote control, which may possess different pages for different devices. However, they reaffirmed the budget of twenty-five per unit and decided to be realistic with the budget."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the propotype presentation about the buttons and main features the remote control.", "answer": "User Interface first summarized the propotype of the remote control discussed before. The remote control should be curved, easy to hold, nice and small with big buttons. Those buttons were a scroll and some push buttons. The body of the remote control shall be smooth plastic or spongy rubber with yellow and black buttons. The remote control would be comfortable to watch because it had suitable curtature and it's on-off was in the back."}
{"instruction": "How did Suzy Davies say about amendment 3A when discussing the amendments in group 3 which relates to the regulation-making powers in the Bill?", "answer": "Suzy Davies thought that one person's technical issue was another person's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny. Suzy Davies was glad that amendment 8 had removed an order provision. Suzy Davies thought amendment 3A was something of a probing amendment. The amendment 3 seek to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it was not a separate commencement power. Amendment 3A was a holding position, which they would return this in Stage 3, because Suzy Davies thought this was an area where this might be valuable to discuss quite what kind of powers were required. Suzy Davies thought there might be something that was beyond transitional, transitory and saving."}
{"instruction": "What did PhD D think about LPC?", "answer": "PhD D expressed that the resynthesized version of the speech that LPC gave was not the same as speech. Though, the excitations were more clear in the resynthesized version."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the size of the device when discussing the overall requirements.", "answer": "The group members firstly made sure how big the seven-inch TFT screen was in reality. And they thought that the remote control should not be too big or too small, it should be fit in hands. Then they discussed how the screen and buttons could be reasonably put on the remote control."}
{"instruction": "Why was the council disagree about WJEC's decision to delay the Welsh/English version?", "answer": "Darren Millar AM thought it was inappropriate to delay the availability of a textbook that was already late on schedule so that the two language version could be published on the same day. John Griffiths worried that the approach would potentially put English students using the English-language version or Welsh students using the Welsh-language version at a disadvantage."}
{"instruction": "What did the group discussed about the portability of the remote control?", "answer": "The group agreed on making it small, but the findability was a problem. The user interface designer suggested that since the remote control was only linked to one TV set, it could stick to somewhere. And in order to reduce the size, the user interface designer further suggested that the remote control could charge within the socket, so it could obtain electricity which was provided from the TV`s power source."}
{"instruction": "Why did they agree with each other when discussing the 'easy to use', 'fashion',  'easy to find' and 'robust' features?", "answer": "Since this product didn't have much complex design, it was designed to be easy to use with a very simple structure. Hence, they all agreed that it was easy to use. As for the fancy part, the product was a banana shape, the fruit design was very up to date and fashionable. For the same reason that it resembled a banana, users would find it easily when they needed to use the remote control. What's more, it had lightning, making it more visible in daily life. The product was surrounded by rubber, enabling it under protection, so the robust feature can be ensured."}
{"instruction": "According to the industrial manager, what characteristics possessed by the tiger were worthy of being studied by the products' design?", "answer": "The industrial manager thought that tigers always went for security, speed and efficiency. These features were also the guidelines in designing the products."}
{"instruction": "What did Project Manager think of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing details of button design and location function?", "answer": "Project Manager was concerned about the power required and the cost. The robust voice recognition service embedded on the computer was exemplified by Project Manager to indicate that such software would drag and dictate, but would also require a lot of memory. Moreover, Project Manager admitted that voice recognition was fancy yet unfeasible within the budget."}
{"instruction": "What was the status of the recording data?", "answer": "The first test set of digits is complete and includes 4,000 lines, each comprising between 1-10 digits. New digits forms were distributed for eliciting different prosodic groupings of numbers. New naming conventions were discussed as means for facilitating the sorting process. Existing files will be changed so that all filenames are of equal length. Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags. Files will also contain information specifying channel, microphone, and broadcaster information."}
{"instruction": "Why did the group give up the idea of positioning symmetrical buttons on both the left and right side?", "answer": "Firstly, despite the convenience of left-handed users, symmetrical button design would create extra buttons and hence inevitably confuse users. Also, Project Manager pointed out that left-handed users have no difficulty handling the remote control by either side of hands. User Interface added that a thumb was sufficient for this motion, so no difference should exist between left and right."}
{"instruction": "What would the team talk about in the next meeting?", "answer": "The team would talk about how to gather information about the contents, set the remote control system browse by channel or browse by contents and to reflect about it."}
{"instruction": "Why did Llyr Gruffydd disagree with Eluned Morgan when discussing the official commitments to help the Wales universities to get through the transition period?", "answer": "When discussing the official commitments, Eluned Morgan had great confidence in the government that they would provide firm support for the Wales universities. But as for Llyr Gruffydd, he did not think that the institutions would be able to rely on the official funding much, and more importantly, if they would like to enter into the agreements at present, they would interrupt their current work, which would also put themselves in great risk."}
{"instruction": "What did the meeting discuss about the mental and emotional health of young people?", "answer": "Kirsty Williams admitted that the qualification examinations would bring pressure to students. In fact, as he pointed out, students were prone to form a wrong impression that the more they had achieved, the more successful they would get. Thus, he expressed his desire to guide the students to make the right decisions in terms of their A-Levels and baccalaureate."}
{"instruction": "What were the modules for the SmartKom.", "answer": "SmartKom should feature a well defined core interface, with domain-specific information kept external. A syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system."}
{"instruction": "What did the group think of market range about remote control?", "answer": "Marketing thought the market included all kinds of people no matter if they were old and young. So it would be better if their aim was the whole world and Britain. Users Interface suggested that market aim should take the remote control style into consideration about. For instance in Britain, people had many things to do with TV. But normal TVs were not like this."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion on how to make it clear to parents that the legislation is not trying to criminalize parents.", "answer": "Sally Jenkins said that this was very broad. Colleagues in education, in social care, in preventative services, and also Welsh Government and the National Assembly were key to this. There were lots of routes that could go through in terms of raising awareness, including preventative services, universal services and regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. It was about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues would help us to do that in the broadest sense."}
{"instruction": "What questions did team members raise concerning Industrial Designer's presentation?", "answer": "Industrial Designer considered batteries as the energy source. Marketing thinks that changing batteries all the time could possibly be annoying, so she suggests other energy options like solar charging. But Industrial Designer refutes this problem because people change batteries simply every six months. User Interface raised the question on the operational distance of the infra-red signal and hoped that the remote control could be equipped with a strong signal stream. But Project Manager rendered it unnecessary because TV is always put in a short distance. Later the team discussed the necessity of through-wall signal and Bluetooth, and decided that this idea remained an idea for some budget reasons and the lack of necessity."}
{"instruction": "What are the potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of researcher collaborations and networks?", "answer": "First of all, whether the Brexit deal might impact adversely on the capacity of the collaborations is still unknown. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. Wales should maintain the quality, maintain the impact, and hopefully grow the critical mass. Dr David Blaney thinks that they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market."}
{"instruction": "What are the functions and characters discussed by the group that a remote control should incorporate?", "answer": "Firstly the group confirmed that their target is a TV remote control. Marketing expects the control to be produced in medium size. User Interface indicated that the control should have a simple practical interface, without a great amount of buttons. Project Manager intended to relate the control with other devices like DVD, HI-FI, video, etc. And the team agreed on the inexpensiveness of the control."}
{"instruction": "What did the team say about the shape of the remote control when talking about the evaluation of two versions and further discussion?", "answer": "The remote control might be made into fruit or vegetable types. So the team might have to change some components, but it would not cost much. The PCB would be the same for all, but only the exterior shape was different for all. They could propose the customers with skins. The team would look into the material."}
{"instruction": "Why didn't the team believe that the remote control could fully depend on speech recognition and have no buttons?", "answer": "Age group data for remote control use was not available; many people may not want to learn to use the new remote control; some buttons are still needed, such as channel control, volume settings and on/off."}
{"instruction": "Which groups were thanked for their efforts?", "answer": "Essential workers were thanked for their efforts in saving lives during the ongoing pandemic. It was noted that the week was Paramedic Services Week in appreciation of their work."}
{"instruction": "What did Paul-Hus think about the introduction of petitions and prioritization of government matters?", "answer": "Mr. Paul-Hus thought that the government should not take firearms away from law-abiding Canadian citizens. He inquired into how the government would take guns from criminals. He also expressed concern about the quick release of dangerous criminals during the pandemic and China's intransparency with regards to the pandemic."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the presentation on the function design.", "answer": "The industrial designer introduced that the product not only had some basic functions, it also had the locator function and provided users with a revolutionary way of zapping. As for the material, the product would be made of plastic and rubber. In addition, the final design was thought to be slightly lighter and smaller than the present model. Later, the group went on to check the controller's paging ability and talked about some details on buttons."}
{"instruction": "How did the infrastructure minister explain to give $1 million in bonuses to the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank rather than to invest in roads, schools, hospitals and long-term care homes?", "answer": "Hon. Catherine McKenna started by introducing the $33 billion infrastructure program in which the government was working directly with the Government of Quebec to build infrastructure that was making a huge difference, including projects in the member's riding. Moreover, the change of management at the Canada Infrastructure Bank marked a new phase in the development of the bank. The government was working to build a modern, public infrastructure, to create jobs, and to make Canada more competitive internationally."}
{"instruction": "Why did User Interface say that it's pretty flexible in the price when talking about two versions of the prototype?", "answer": "The product would have basic functions and if users wanted more they need to pay more. For example, if users wanted LCD and speech recognisers with the microphone, they would pay more, else they could just buy the simpler one."}
{"instruction": "Summarize what was said on Control and Further Modifications", "answer": "Postdoc F said or a control experiment,  having a number of meetings with a smaller group of people may be useful. Since most of the meetings currently have between five and eight people, the control would have three person meetings."}
{"instruction": "What did the team discuss about CVS security?", "answer": "While remote CVS access seemed to be working, the team was unsure about setting up a CVS server on a new port. That required a password mechanism. But the team thought an anonymous CVS might be good to store transcripts as it relied on open source software."}
{"instruction": "What did the group think about the deisgn when talking about the evaluation of the remote control?", "answer": "The remote control was quite fancy in the respect of appearance. The group picked the word elegant from aesthetic, trendy, elegant and stylish when User Interface suggested using a different word to describe the remote control. Still, they all agreed that fancy was more appropriate than elegant."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the current XML format to link up different components in data", "answer": "C developed an XML format that links together utterances based on time tags, essentially creating a lattice. The XML format would be divided into many sections, each with its own ID and timeline tag. The XML format could be modified to deal with smaller linguistic units since that would only entail changing the timestamps. Despite being easy to use, the format was not efficient for smaller linguistic units, like phones. It would work for word units, at best."}
{"instruction": "Will the Minister of Foreign Affairs thank Taiwan officially for the donation?", "answer": "The Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested the importance of One China agreement but also expressed great gratitudes towards all the donors across the world. The cooperation between every area in the world was welcomed and it would be glad to see global efforts to battle the Covid-19 virus."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion of group warming and the introduction to the new remote control project.", "answer": "Mutual greeting heralded the beginning of the meeting and the goal of the new remote control project was introduced by Project Manager to the conferees as to win over competitive products by being original, trendy and user-friendly. Then Project Manager continued with the introduction of the design process, which was divided into three main parts—functional design, conceptual design and desired design that respectively focused on the user-related technical functions, desirable user interface and different trends involved, and specific implementation and choice-detailing process of conceptual design."}
{"instruction": "Why did the team discuss the merits and demerits of the existing remotes?", "answer": "In general, the team only collected the flaws of the existing remotes. According to the User Interface, the existing remotes were difficult to use because of the inconsistent layout, too many buttons and shape problems. For each problem, the team tried to give the solution. For example, their new remotes would have a standard layout, limited buttons and organic shapes. It was believed that by solving all these problems, the new remotes would be easy for the customers to use."}
{"instruction": "What is project manager's opinion towards the goal of the new remote control project?", "answer": "The project manager considered that the goal of the new remote control project was to design a new and original remote control which is trendy and user-friendly. He wanted its price to be 25 Euro and it would be sold all over the world."}
{"instruction": "What did the group think about microphone position on the remote control?", "answer": "Marketing thought it was easy with a microphone on the remote control so that it was easy to find. User Interface agreed and thought it was better to put the microphone in a corner. Industrial Designer thought no matter where the microphone was, it would not be visible. So where to place didn't matter. Project Manager thought the microphone should be in an important position to see because it was a special selling point of remote control."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the evaluation of two versions and further discussion.", "answer": "Marketing made evaluation criteria. The first thing was fancy look and feel, the second was innovativeness, the third was easy to use. Then Marketing asked Industrial Designer and User Interface to give scores towards two versions of the prototype according to the scale. Both Industrial Designer and User Interface gave three or four points to look and feel, six points to innovativeness and also six points to easy to use. The team decided to make the remote control without LCD and to improve the design to make it fancy. They would have all the functions in the same set, but some functions, like speech recognition, would be optional. The team would look into the shape and material of the set."}
{"instruction": "What did the meeting discuss about the advantage of the Act?", "answer": "Although highly challenged by the participants, Kirsty Williams AM argued that the Act had fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. These strategic aims were still really important but in the new situation, it was required to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England. In this case, to continue fulfilling its national outcomes, the Act should evolve by implementing new student support measures."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about the features and appearances of the new remotes.", "answer": "In the second half of the meeting, the team discussed the details of the features and appearances of the new remotes. Lots of ideas and proposals were raised, but many of them were denied or modified later. In the end, the team reached a consensus that their new remotes would have batteries that could be recharged, pale yellow slogans, fruits-based shapes and sponge rubber material."}
{"instruction": "What did User Interface think of adding support for DVD players to the remote control?", "answer": "User Interface disagreed on adding support for DVD players to the remote control as the email stated that it should be a television remote control."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the discussion about issues related to the potential closures of colleges and universities.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, they had been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that had been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. They had got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. There was still a safety net idea. Colleges had indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they would have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. Any Welsh Government support going to stay, whatever the circumstances were. They would do their best to ensure that there would be no disruption to EMA."}
{"instruction": "Summarize discussion on issues with data storage", "answer": "The team felt that the current file system they were using was running out of space, specifically back-up capacity. They needed to figure out a way to back-up the data they were collecting. They decided that the tape system that ICSI has is pretty reliable. But they needed to discuss the matter with the system administrator."}
{"instruction": "What is the future for data collection?", "answer": "As the data collection is going into its second phase, more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues. Subjects can be recruited from within the Psychology department students, since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus."}
{"instruction": "What did Project Manager’s think of the water-proof design when discussing the designing requirements of the new remote control?", "answer": "Considering the product originality, Project Manager believed that a water-proof remote control could be used in the bath conveniently while saving the customer’s need to purchase an extra plastic cover. Therefore, originality and competitiveness might be gained over competitive products."}
